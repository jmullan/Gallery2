    <p>
      Welcome to Gallery 2.0 (G2). This is the first
      &ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; release of G2, code named <b>&ldquo;Cowbell&rdquo;</b>.
      Please read through this document carefully before installing G2
      and before asking for help.  We have taken care to try to answer
      as many of your questions here as possible.

    <h2><a name="quick_start">Quick Start</a></h2>
    <p>
      If you&rsquo;re impatient like me, you just want to get going.  The
      odds are that your system is mostly all set to handle G2 so just
      skip right to the <a href="install/" target="_guided">installer</a> and start
      clicking.  It should walk you through everything you need to get
      going and you can come back here and read more if you hit a
      snag.  Enjoy.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="what_is_gallery">What is Gallery?</a></h2>
    <p>
      Gallery is a web based software product that lets you manage your photos
      on your own website.  You must have your own website with PHP support in
      order to install and use it.  With Gallery you can easily create and
      maintain albums of photos via an intuitive interface.  Photo management
      includes automatic thumbnail creation, image resizing, rotation, ordering,
      captioning, searching and more.  Albums can have read, write and caption
      permissions per individual authenticated user for an additional level of
      privacy.  Give accounts to your friends and family and let them upload and
      manage their own photos on your website!
    </p>

    <h2><a name="what_is_g2">What is G2 Alpha?</a></h2>
    <p>
      An Alpha version or Alpha release is the first official release
      of a product.  An Alpha release will probably be unstable,
      contain both known and unknown bugs, and will be missing some
      intended features.  We release it early so that you can see what
      is coming and give us feedback that will help us improve the
      final release.
    </p>
    
    <h2><a name="Alpha_requirements">G2 Alpha requirements</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Webserver that can run PHP (Apache 1, Apache 2, IIS, Zeus, etc)
      </li>
      <li>
	PHP version 4.1.0 or more recent (including PHP 5).  <b>Note:</b> <i>safe_mode</i> must be disabled!
      </li>
      <li>
	One of the following databases: MySQL 3.x, MySQL 4.x, or PostgreSQL 7.x
      </li>
      <li>
	One of the following graphics toolkits: NetPBM 9.x or ImageMagick 5.x
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="when_to_use">When to use G2 Alpha</a></h2>
    <p>
      You should install G2 Alpha to try it out.  You could install it next to
      your production version of Gallery 1.x in a hidden directory.  You could
      install it on a development server.  We want you to try it, test it, break
      it, and tell us all about it.  Get your friends and colleagues to poke
      around.  However, please be prepared to delete your G2 Alpha installation
      and all of the data at any time and start over from scratch.
    </p>
      
    <h2><a name="when_not_to_use">When not to use G2 Alpha</a></h2>
    <p>
      Do not use it as the main repository for your data.  Do not use
      it for a production web site.  We will probably not provide an
      easy upgrade path to the next release until we reach beta.  We
      know that it&rsquo;s much better than G1, and it may be tempting to
      just replace your G1 with it.  But be warned that we know that
      <b>the database schema will change</b> between now and beta and
      we won&rsquo;t support upgrading your G2 Alpha data so if you use it
      in production, you&rsquo;re on your own.
    </p>

    <div class="important">
      <h3>Warning</h3> 
      <span>
	G2 has not yet been subjected to a rigorous security audit!
	While we have taken great pains to make sure that it is
	secure, there is still the chance that there are some big
	security holes in it that might cause you trouble.  If you
	find a security flaw, please <a
	  href="mailto:gallery@menalto.com">contact us</a> right away!
      </span>
    </div>

    <h2><a name="whats_new">What&rsquo;s new in G2 Alpha</a></h2>
    <p>
      G2 has been redesigned from the ground up and is database
      driven! It is secure, scalable, reliable, modular, customizable,
      portable and intuitive.  In short, we looked at all the things
      we did wrong in G1 and we did them again the right way.  Two
      years of design and development have gone into G2.  It&rsquo;s got
      customizable themes and layouts using XHTML compliant templates
      which makes it much easier for you to personalize your G2
      install.  All the cool bells and whistles are in modules that
      can be enabled separately for maximum control.  
    </p>

    <h2><a name="prerequisites">G2 Alpha Installation Prerequisites</a></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
	<b><a name="get_latest_code">Latest Version</a></b> - 
	There are two ways to get the code. 
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <b>Tarball</b> - You can download a prepackaged file as a
	    tarball or a zip file from <a href=
	      "http://sourceforge.net/projects/gallery/"
	      target="_blank">SourceForge</a>.  
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <b>CVS</b> - This is a better way to get the latest code,
	    but it&rsquo;s for <i>advanced</i> users.  Follow the <a
	      href="http://gallery.sourceforge.net/wiki.php?page=DownloadingGalleryUsingCVS"
	      target="_blank">CVS instructions</a> to obtain the latest G2
	    code.  It&rsquo;s easier to stay up to date with this method since
	    you can run one command and get the latest code at any time.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b>Storage</b> - Create a directory for gallery to store
	photos.  This must be writable by the web server, but for
	security reasons we suggest that you do not put it in the web
	root.  If you put it in the web root, then it circumvents G2&rsquo;s
	security.  
	<div class="instructions">
	  <h3>Unix Example</h3>
	  <code>
	    % cd $HOME <br/>
	    % mkdir gallerydata <br/>
	    % chmod 777 gallerydata
	  </code>
	</div>
	
	<div class="instructions">
	  <h3>Windows Example</h3>
	  <code>
	    C:\> mkdir gallerydata
	  </code>
	</div>

	In the Unix example, you may note that modes of 777 on your
	gallerydata directory are not all that secure.  However, making it
	more secure depends on how your system is configured.  Talk
	with your system administrator about ways to change the
	permissions on that directory to make it so that Gallery can
	still write to the files but that others can&rsquo;t.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b>Database</b> - Right now we support <a
	href="http://www.postgresql.org/mirrors-ftp.html" target=
	"_blank">PostgreSQL</a> and <a
	href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/"
	target="_blank">MySQL</a>.  MySQL is generally faster than
	PostgreSQL. We require you to create the database yourself.
	In our examples below, we&rsquo;ll be creating a database called
	<b>gallery2</b>.  You can use any database name that you
	choose.

	<div class="instructions">
	  <h3>MySQL</h3>
	  <code>
	    mysqladmin -uroot create gallery2  <br />
	    mysql gallery2 -uroot -e"GRANT ALL ON gallery2.* TO <strong>username</strong>@localhost IDENTIFIED BY <strong>'password'</strong>" <br />
	  </code>
	</div>

	<ul class="note">
	  <li> Choose your own <strong>username</strong> and
	    <strong>password</strong>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    If mysql denies you access, try adding "-p" right before the "-e "
	  </li>
	</ul>	

	<div class="instructions">
	  <h3>PostgreSQL</h3>
	  <code>
	    createdb gallery2
	  </code>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b>Graphics Toolkits</b> - G2 works with <a
	  href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">NetPBM</a> or <a
	  href="http://imagemagick.org" target="_blank">ImageMagick</a>.  They&rsquo;re both
	equally good, though some say that NetPBM has slightly better
	quality and ImageMagick is slightly faster.
	If you install these in default, or standard, locations then G2
	will auto-detect them during G2 installation.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="installing">Installing G2 Alpha</a></h2>
    <p>
      Open up your web browser and browse to the <a href="install/" target="_guided">G2
      install directory</a>.  G2 will walk you through the process of
      validating that your system is properly configured and will set
      everything up for you.
      <em><strong>Note</strong> - the installer requires that you have cookies
      enabled in your browser!</em>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	<b> Authenticate </b> - You will be asked to create and save a
	small text file in order to authenticate, If ths step is
	successful you can proceed to Step 2.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Install Checks </b> - This is where we would check to make
	sure that all your files have been uploaded properly. This is
	not implemented in this alpha release. Go onto Step 3.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> System Checks </b> - The installer looks for valid
	versions of PHP and other items. Proceed to Step 4.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Admin User Setup </b> - You are prompted for an
	administrator username and password. In this alpha release the
	default Admin username is set to <strong>admin</strong> and
	cannot be changed during the install process(though you can
	change it to something else later on). Type in a password and
	type it again to validate it. Then click 'Create' to create
	the admin user for this installation of Gallery 2. You are
	them prompted to go to Step 5.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Storge Setup </b> - Read the instructions on the installer
	to set up a storage location for Gallery 2. Save this path,
	then proceed to Step 6.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Database Setup </b> - This is where you select your
	database type and enter your database authentication
	information. Select and enter the corerct information and save
	it. Proceed to Step 7.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Finished! </b> - Congratulations! Your Gallery 2 Alpha has
	successfully installed! See... that wasn't so hard, was it? 
	Now it's time to upload some photos! Click on 'Go to my
	Gallery!'
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="getting_started">Getting started with G2 Alpha</a></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
	<b> Log in </b> - Once you&rsquo;ve successfully got G2 Alpha installed, you should
	start by <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core:UserAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core:UserLogin&amp;g2_form[formName]=UserLogin&amp;g2_form[username]=admin" target="_guided">logging
	in</a> as the admin user that was created for you at install
	time.  The admin user has special privileges that you&rsquo;ll need
	in order to administer your new G2.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Activate Graphics Toolkits </b> - Click on the <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin" target="_guided">Site Admin</a> link
	then the <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core:AdminModules" target="_guided">Modules</a>
	link to see the module list.  Install, configure and activate
	either the NetPBM or ImageMagick modules.  You can activate
	both if you want.  If your graphics toolkits are in well known
	places, then they may already be activated.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Add an album </b> - Browse back to <a href="main.php" target="_guided">the
	top of your new G2</a> and click on the <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core:ItemAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core:ItemAddAlbum&amp;g2_itemId=6" target="_guided">Add
	Album</a> link from the drop-down on the left side of the page.
	This will give you a form where you can enter information
	about the new album you want to create.  Fill it out and submit it.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Add photos to your album </b> - Now that you have a new
	album, click on the <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core:ItemAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core:ItemAdd&amp;g2_itemId=8" target="_guided">Add
	Items</a> link.  This will bring up a page with four different
	upload options.  Select the one you want and try adding a new
	photo to your album.  If all goes well, you should see the new photos in your <a href="main.php?g2_view=core:ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=8" target="_guided">new album!</a>.  Congratulations!
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Migrate G1 albums </b> - you can easily import albums from
	G1.  It won&rsquo;t cause any harm to your G1 (or at least, it&rsquo;s not
	supposed to).  Just go to the <a href="main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin&amp;g2_subView=migrate:SelectGallery" target="_guided">Migration Page</a> in
	the site administrator and enter the path to your G1 albums
	directory and then follow the instructions.  

	<br/>

        <i> Note </i> - there are <a href="#known_issues">known
        issues</a> with the migration module.  Please read about them
        before filing bugs!

      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Plenty to do and see! </b> - 
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Explore the different <a href="main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin" target="_guided">Site Admin</a> options
	    and tune your G2 the way that you want it.
	  </li>
	    
	  <li>
	    You can <a href="main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core:AdminLayouts" target="_guided">activate different layouts</a> and then experiment with layouts and themes when <a href="main.php?g2_view=core:ItemAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core:ItemEdit&amp;g2_itemId=8" target="_guided">editing your new album</a>.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    You can <a href="main.php?g2_view=search:SearchScan&amp;g2_form[useDefaultSettings]=1" target="_guided">search your G2</a> and view the <a href="main.php?g2_view=members:MembersList" target="_guided">members list</a>.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    If the ffmpeg module is activated, you can upload movies and it will automatically create thumbnails of them for you.
	  </li>

	  <li> 
	    Try uploading really wide images and then edit them to put them in Panorama mode to activate the panorama viewer.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Activate the cart and photoaccess modules, add all the photos from an album
	    to the cart and try printing them all at once (you can
	    cancel the print job at the last second so it&rsquo;s ok to play
	    around with this)
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <a
	    href="main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core:AdminUsers" target="_guided">Create
	    some new users</a> then <a
	    href="http://www.menalto.com/demo/dev/main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core:AdminGroups" target="_guided">create
	    some new groups</a> and then try adding users to groups.
	    You can assign permissions to entire groups instead of
	    individual users, which makes permission management much
	    easier.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Try uploading a Shockwave or a Director file.  You can view them inline.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Try uploading an MP3 and see that it&rsquo;s got a custom
	    thumbnail.  Then use the <a
	    href="main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin&amp;g2_subView=thumbnail:ThumbnailSiteAdmin" target="_guided">thumbnail
	    manager</a> to upload your own custom thumbnails for
	    different file types.  G2 lets you upload files of any type!
	  </li>

	</ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="getting_help">Getting Help</a></h2>
    <p>
      If you have problems, you should start by looking in the <a
      href="http://gallery.menalto.com/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&amp;file=viewforum&amp;f=10" target="_blank">G2
      General Development Forum</a> on the <a
      href="http://gallery.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">Gallery Website</a>.  Look
      to see if somebody else has posted a similar problem and maybe
      there&rsquo;s an answer there. Failing that, you can <a
      href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=7130&amp;atid=107130" target="_blank">file
      a bug</a> in our bug tracker on SourceForge.  Please read our <a
      href="http://gallery.sourceforge.net/wiki.php?page=Feature%20Requests%20and%20Bug%20Reports" target="_blank">tracker
      guidelines</a> before filing a bug so that we can cut down on
      the number of spurious reports. Finally you can try to catch one
      of the G2 developers on our irc channel, <a href=
      "irc://irc.freenode.net/#gallery" target="_blank">#gallery on
      irc.freenode.net</a>.  Please remember that our users outnumber
      our developers by many orders of magnitude, and our developers
      are doing this in their spare time, so be considerate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember &ndash; reporting bugs is <b>good</b>.  Even if you think
      it&rsquo;s silly, go ahead and report it.  We can always close the bug
      or refile it (please don&rsquo;t be offended in this case) but it&rsquo;s
      harder to find bugs than it is to fix them so we&rsquo;re counting on
      you to help us with the finding part.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="known_issues">Known Issues / Bugs</a></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
	<b>Upgrade Path</b> - There&rsquo;s no upgrade path from this
	version of G2 Alpha to future versions.  You&rsquo;ll have to throw
	out all your data and start over when the next Alpha or beta
	release comes out.  We will offer an upgrade path as we get
	closer to beta.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>G1 -> G2 Migration</b> - 
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Migration does not preserve album order currently.  Your
	    albums may show up in a seemingly random order.
	  </li>
	  <li> 
	    Migration seems to abort after 5 minutes so if you do a
	    large import and it suddenly stops without giving you any
	    feedback, you might want to import in small chunks of
	    albums for now.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    If your G1 uses a character set besides UTF-8, any
	    non-ASCII characters in your captions, description, and
	    comments will probably be displayed incorrectly.
	    Converting them to UTF-8 (and then HTML entities) is one
	    of the high-priority post-alpha tasks.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Performance</b> - G2 is not as fast as we want it to be.
	We know about this and know how to greatly improve it.  We&rsquo;ve
	been focused on features and reliability before performance,
	and will optimize during the Alpha cycle.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> MembersList shows email addresses to everybody </b> - this is a known
        issue that we will fix in an upcoming release.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="updating">Updating your Gallery 2 Installation</a></h2>
    <p>
      Until G2 hits beta, you <i>may</i> have to discard your current
      G2 data any time you upgrade.  The proper way to upgrade is to
      <a href="#get_latest_code">get the latest code</a> and overwrite
      your existing copy with it.  If you see weird errors, then
      it&rsquo;s time to delete your database.
    </p>
    
    <div class="instructions">
      <h3>MySQL</h3>
      <code>
	mysqladmin -uroot drop gallery2
      </code>
    </div>
	
    <div class="instructions">
      <h3>PostgreSQL</h3>
      <code>
	dropdb gallery2
      </code>
    </div>

    <ul class="note">
      <li> These commands assumes the database is called <strong>gallery2</strong> </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Make sure you delete the contents of your
      gallerydata directory (but leave the directory itself around).
    </p>

    <div class="instructions">
      <h3> Unix </h3>
      <code>
	/bin/rm -rf /path/to/gallerydata/*
      </code>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
      <h3> Windows </h3>
      <code>
	cd c:\ <br/>
	rd /s /q gallerydata <br/>
	mkdir gallerydata <br/>
      </code>
    </div>

    <p>
      finally, <a href="#installing">perform a complete reinstall</a>.
      Yes, we know that doing all of this sucks, and when we get to
      beta we'll have an upgrade path so that you can just update the
      code and it will Do the Right Thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      We sneaky developer types have a back-door that lets us do
      reinstalls much faster.  You can play with this too, but we ask
      that if something weird is going on, you verify that any bugs
      you&rsquo;re seeing happen when you do the install by hand, so that we
      know they&rsquo;re not caused by our little back-door shenanigans.
    </p>

    <p>
      The back door is to go to the <a href="lib/tools/test/" target="_guided">old test
      harness</a> and run the ReInitializeGallery test.  This will
      <b>immediately</b> nuke your entire G2 from orbit (it&rsquo;s the only
      way to be sure) and start all over again.  Be careful, we warned
      you.  <i>Note</i> - the ReInitializeGallery test may insert some
      strange default paths into your G2 since they&rsquo;re useful to our
      developers.  You can delete them.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="advanced_topics">Advanced Topics</a></h2>
    <p>
      <b> Unit Tests </b> - G2 was designed using Extreme Programming
      methodologies.  This means that we have a ton of unit tests that
      help us make sure that the code is behaving as it should.  If
      you want to help us out, you can <a href="lib/tools/phpunit/"
      target="_guided">try running the unit tests</a> and report back
      to us if any of them fail.  <i> Note </i> - these tests
      shouldn&rsquo;t change your G2 settings at all, but if they fail, they
      may leave things in a weird state.  Be warned that you might
      have to ditch your G2 data and start over if something
      catastrophic happens.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Test Harness </b> - We also have an <a
      href="lib/tools/test/" target="_guided">older test harness</a> that
      we use to do some load testing type tasks that might be fun to
      experiment with.  Try creating 1000 users or a random tree of
      5,000 photos to see what it&rsquo;s like.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Localization </b> - If you&rsquo;re interested in localizing
      G2 into another language, you can <a
      href="lib/tools/reports/localization.php"
      target="_guided">review the current state of localization</a>
      and then <a href="docs/LOCALIZING" target="_guided">read the
      localization how-to</a> and get started.  <a
      href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=582564&amp;group_id=7130&amp;func=browse"
      target="_guided">Submit your localizations</a> early and often -
      no need to wait until you&rsquo;re entirely done.
