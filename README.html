      Welcome to Gallery 2.0 (G2). This is the fourth and final
      &ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; release of G2, code named <b>&ldquo;Nice
      Commits&rdquo;</b>.  Please read through this document carefully
      before installing G2 and before asking for help.  We have taken
      care to try to answer as many of your questions here as
      possible.  If you don't read this and have problems, we may

    <p>
      If you&rsquo;re impatient like us, you just want to get going.
      The odds are that your system is mostly all set to handle G2 so
      just skip right to the <a href="install/"
      target="_guided">installer</a> and start clicking.  It should
      walk you through everything you need to get going.  But before
      you do that, you should really read the <a

      href="#when_not_to_use">When not to use G2 Alpha</a> sections!
      <b>But</b> if you hit a snag, please come back here and read
      more before asking questions!  Enjoy.

    <h2><a name="what_is_gallery">What is Gallery?</a></h2>
    <p>
      Gallery is a web based software product that lets you manage your photos
      on your own website.  You must have your own website with PHP support in
      order to install and use it.  With Gallery you can easily create and
      maintain albums of photos via an intuitive interface.  Photo management
      includes automatic thumbnail creation, image resizing, rotation, ordering,
      captioning, searching and more.  Albums can have read, write and caption
      permissions per individual authenticated user for an additional level of
      privacy.  Give accounts to your friends and family and let them upload and
      manage their own photos on your website!
    </p>

    <h2><a name="what_is_g2">What is G2 Alpha?</a></h2>
    <p>
      An Alpha version or Alpha release is the first official release
      of a product.  An Alpha release is usually unstable, contains
      both known and unknown bugs, and is missing some intended
      features.  We release it early so that you can see what is
      coming and give us feedback that will help us improve the final
      release.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="Alpha_requirements">G2 Alpha requirements</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Web server that can run PHP (Apache 1, Apache 2, IIS, Zeus, etc)
      </li>
      <li>
	PHP version 4.1.0 or more recent (including PHP 5).
	<br/>
	<b>Note:</b> <i>safe_mode</i> must be disabled!
      </li>
      <li>
	One of the following databases: MySQL 3.x, MySQL 4.x, PostgreSQL 7.x, Oracle 9i or 10g
      </li>
      <li>
	One of the following graphics toolkits: <a target="_blank"
	href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/">NetPBM</a> 9.x or newer, <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> 5.x or newer, <a target="_blank"
	href="http://php.net/gd">GD</a> 2.x or newer (or else you get no thumbnails!)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="when_to_use">When to use G2 Alpha</a></h2>
    <p>
      You should install G2 Alpha to try it out.  You could install it
      next to your production version of Gallery 1.x in a hidden
      directory.  You could install it on a development server.  We
      want you to try it, test it, break it, and tell us all about it.
      Get your friends and colleagues to poke around.  However, please
      be prepared to delete your G2 Alpha installation and all of the
      data at any time and start over from scratch.  You can use the
      migration module to import a few of your G1 albums into G2 for
      test purposes (this shouldn&rsquo;t affect your G1 installation at
      all).
    </p>

    <h2><a name="when_not_to_use">When not to use G2 Alpha</a></h2>
    <p>
      Do not use it as the main repository for your data.  Do not use
      it for a production web site.  We will probably not provide an
      easy upgrade path to the next release until we reach beta.  We
      know that it&rsquo;s much better than G1, and it may be tempting to
      just replace your G1 with it.  But be warned that we know that
      <b>the database schema will change</b> between now and beta and
      we won&rsquo;t support upgrading your G2 Alpha data so if you use it
      in production, you&rsquo;re on your own.
    </p>

    <div class="important">
      <h3>Warning!</h3>
      <span>
	G2 has not yet been subjected to a rigorous security audit!
	While we have taken great pains to make sure that it is
	secure, there is still the chance that there are some big
	security holes in it that might cause you trouble.  If you
	find a security flaw, please contact us at <a
	href="mailto:gallery@menalto.com">gallery@menalto.com</a>
	right away!
      </span>
    </div>

    <h2><a name="whats_new">What&rsquo;s new in G2 Alpha</a></h2>

    <p>
      G2 has been redesigned from the ground up and is database driven! It is secure,
      scalable, reliable, modular, customizable, portable and intuitive. In short,
      we looked at all the things we did wrong in G1 and we did them again the right
      way. Two years of design and development have gone into G2. It&rsquo;s got customizable
      themes and layouts using XHTML compliant templates which makes it much easier
      for you to personalize your G2 install. All the cool bells and whistles are
      in modules that can be enabled separately for maximum control.

      Highlight of changes in Gallery 2 Alpha 4 (Nice Commits)
      <span id="alpha4-toggle" class="toggle"
       onclick="toggle('alpha4-list', 'alpha4-toggle')"> + </span>
    </h3>
    <ol id="alpha4-list" style="display:none">
      <li>
	<b> Upgradeable Core and Modules </b> - At long last we
	support upgrading from one version of G2 to the next.
	Unfortunately, this may not work reliably for all version
	before Alpha 4, so we recommend that you reinstall Alpha 4
	from scratch just to be sure.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Module Uninstall </b> - You can now completely uninstall a
	module and then delete it from your Gallery 2 installation.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Installer Improvements </b>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The interface for installing modules is now much easier to
	    use.  It shows you all the modules and lets you select the
	    ones you want to install, and lets you repeat the process
	    as often as you like.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Added better instructions and examples for several steps
	    that were confusing (your user feedback at work!)
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The installer now works on browsers that don't allow
	    cookies.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> User Interface enhancements </b> - Some changes in our
	main layout place the most important system links on top of
	every page (Site Admin, Login, Logout, ...). This gives you
	easy access to these commands. The sidebar has some improved
	functionality, like a direct login form and some more details
	on your cart and members (if those modules are active). This
	is another step towards a "block" system where modules can
	provide any amount of blocks of information to be placed in
	the sidebar.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Navigation </b> - It's now easier to navigate around Gallery.
	Meaningful "back" links will bring you back to the last last
	visited pages, e.g. it's now possible to visit the Site Admin
	while editing an album and have an easy way to return.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Random Highlight </b> - New module allows albums to
	periodically change highlight, selecting randomly from
	the album's items.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> WebCam </b> - New module creates items that
	periodically refresh the image from an external URL.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Thumbnail Page </b> - New module gives more control
	over thumbnails for movies and documents.  For multipage
	documents (like PDF/Postscript) or images (like multiscene
	TIFF) you can pick the page number for the thumbnail (Note:
	PDF/Postscript require both ImageMagick and Ghostscript).
	When used in conjunction with the Ffmpeg module you can
	pick a time offset for generating thumbnails for movies.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Graphics Toolkits </b> -
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The ImageMagick and NetPBM toolkits have been optimized
	    to make fewer calls to external binaries when used for
	    multiple operations.  For example, cropping and resizing
	    to make a thumbnail now requires only a single call to
	    "convert" with ImageMagick.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    We now preserve extra operations (like crop settings) on
	    thumbnails when moving an item between albums or
	    rebuilding thumbnails.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Added ability to set toolkit priority.  This means you
	    can activate multiple toolkits to support more mime types
	    but still select which toolkit is used in cases where
	    multiple toolkits support the same type.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Added support for ImageMagick 6.1.x
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Sort Order </b> - "Default sort order" and "Manual sort
	order" are now separate choices, allowing albums to properly
	inherit the site default for sort order; Ascending/descending
	is disabled for these choices.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> New Items </b> - New module shows "new" and "updated"
	images next to appropriate images and albums, and adds a new
	sort where new items are shown first followed by other items
	sorted by view count.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> SMTP Authentication </b> - We now support sending email
	via a SMTP server that requires user authentication.  Any
	module that sends email (like the registration module) can
	take advantage of this support.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Embedding G2 </b> - We've made great improvements in
	embedding Gallery 2 into other applications.  We've
	successfully (though not completely) embedded it into Xaraya
	and have begun working on other platforms.  There's now a
	rudimentary <a href="docs/EMBEDDING">document</a> to
	explain how to do it.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Thumbnail Creation </b> - We now let you create thumbnails
	at upload time, which greatly improves performance the first
	time you view an album.  It's optional, but on by default.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Improved Error Pages </b> - We now show you a nice error
	page when two simultaneous and conflicting changes happen.
	This new page explains how to resolve the problem.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Members </b> - We now show a list of the recent
	changes that a user has made, and let you page through the
	entire list of changes.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Removed IE7 </b> - We were experimenting with <a
	href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/" target="_blank">IE7</a>,
	a compatibility layer in Javascript reduces some of the
	incompatibilities between IE6 and other browsers.  However we
	were not able to get the performance and reliability that we
	needed so we've decided to abandon using it (at least for now).
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Localization </b> - Gallery 2 is now translated into 18 languages, though only
	German, Danish and Swedish are over 50% translated.  We can
	use your help!
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Bug fixes </b> - Many bugs closed!
      </li>
    </ol>

    </h3>
    <ol id="alpha3-list" style="display:none">
      <li>
	<b> Watermark Support </b> - We now support image
	watermarking.  You can add a watermark to the thumbnail,
	resize or full sized version of an image using a DHTML
	drag-and-drop interface.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Oracle Database Support </b> - The installer now offers
	Oracle (version 9i and higher) among the supported database types.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Module Manifests </b> - All modules now come with a
	manifest file, and the installer checks to make sure that
	you&rsquo;ve got a complete set of files on the server.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Auto Completion </b> - the Site Admin user and groups
	pages, and the permissions pages now perform appropriate
	completion for you.  Just type a few characters of the
	username you&rsquo;re searching for and it&rsquo;ll give you up to 10
	possible matches.  Tested on Firefox, but not extensively
	tested on IE yet.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> New version of IE7 </b> - We&rsquo;re experimenting with <a
	href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/" target="_blank">IE7</a>,
	a compatibility layer in Javascript reduces some of the
	incompatibilities between IE6 and other browsers.  The older
	version caused weird problems with images getting overlayed
	with a red X, or IE6 crashing.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Migration improvements </b> -
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    We now properly migrate item owners
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    We now preserve the order of imported subalbums
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    G1 summary and description fields are now transposed on
	    import so that the G1 "summary" (which was shown inside
	    the album itself) is now the G2 "description" and vice
	    versa.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> CMS Integration </b> - Although this is not yet readily visible, a
	great deal of work has been done on getting G2 ready to integrate into
	external content management systems.  We&rsquo;ve successfully done partial
	integrations with <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.xaraya.com/">Xaraya</a> and <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, with more on the way.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Square Thumbnails </b> - We fixed a noticeable bug where
	the first time you viewed a square thumbnail it might appear
	distorted (this was mentioned in the "known bugs" list of the
	alpha-2 release).

      <li>
	<b> User Interface </b> - Many small and large user interface
	improvements.  Made the XHTML more standards compliant and
	used less divs in favor of more sensible tags (like h1, h2,
	etc).
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Performance </b> - Significant performance increases in
	general, and especially for image views.  This also reduces
	the overall load on your system when (for example)
	viewing a page with 9 thumbnails on it.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Installer </b> - The installer now installs the core
	module for you, as well as allows you to optionally install
	other modules right away instead of having to do it later via
	the Site Admin.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Custom Fields </b> - New custom field module allows you to
	define global and per-album custom fields for your item meta
	data.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Java Upload Applet </b> - New upload option where you can
	drag and drop files onto an applet and G2 will upload them for you.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> GD Graphics toolkit </b> - Implemented <a target="_blank"
	href="http://php.net/gd">GD</a> based graphics toolkit.  This enables
	use of PHP&rsquo;s built-in imaging functions for thumbnails, resizes,
	cropping and rotating.  Requires GD 2.0 or newer.  No external binaries
	needed.

    <h2><a name="prerequisites">G2 Alpha Installation Prerequisites</a></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
	<b><a name="get_latest_code">Latest Version</a></b> -
	There are two ways to get the code.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <b>Tarball</b> - You can download a prepackaged file as a
	    tarball or a zip file from <a href=
	      "http://sourceforge.net/projects/gallery/"
	      target="_blank">SourceForge</a>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <b>CVS</b> - This is a better way to get the latest code,
	    but it&rsquo;s for <i>advanced</i> users.  Follow the <a
	      href="http://gallery.sourceforge.net/wiki.php?page=DownloadingGalleryUsingCVS"
	      target="_blank">CVS instructions</a> to obtain the latest G2
	    code.  It&rsquo;s easier to stay up to date with this method since
	    you can run one command and get the latest code at any time.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b>Storage</b> - Create a directory for gallery to store
	photos.  This must be writable by the web server, but for
	security reasons we suggest that you do not put it in the web
	root.  If you put it in the web root, then anybody can get
	directly to your images with their web browser which
	circumvents G2&rsquo;s security.
	<div class="instructions">
	  <h3>Unix Example</h3>
	  <code>
	    % cd $HOME <br/>
	    % mkdir g2data <br/>
	    % chmod 777 g2data
	  </code>
	</div>

	<div class="instructions">
	  <h3>Windows Example</h3>
	  <code>
	    C:\> mkdir g2data
	  </code>
	</div>

	In the Unix example, you may note that modes of 777 on your
	<tt>g2data</tt> directory are not all that secure.  However, making it
	more secure depends on how your system is configured.  Talk
	with your system administrator about ways to change the
	permissions on that directory to make it so that Gallery can
	still write to the files but that others can&rsquo;t.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b>Database</b> - Right now we support <a
	href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/"
	target="_blank">MySQL</a>, <a
	href="http://www.postgresql.org/mirrors-ftp.html" target=
	"_blank">PostgreSQL</a> and <a
	href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/index.html"
	target="_blank">Oracle</a>.  MySQL is generally faster than
	PostgreSQL. We require you to create the database yourself.
	In our examples below, we&rsquo;ll be creating a database called
	<b>gallery2</b>.  You can use any database name that you
	choose.

	<div class="instructions">
	  <h3>MySQL</h3>
	  <code>
	    mysqladmin -uroot create gallery2  <br />
	    mysql gallery2 -uroot -e"GRANT ALL ON gallery2.* TO <strong>username</strong>@localhost IDENTIFIED BY <strong>'password'</strong>" <br />
	  </code>
	</div>

	<ul class="note">
	  <li> Choose your own <strong>username</strong> and
	    <strong>password</strong>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    If MySQL denies you access, try adding "-p" right before the "-e "
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<div class="instructions">
	  <h3>PostgreSQL</h3>
	  <code>
	    createdb gallery2
	  </code>
        </div>

	<div class="instructions">
	  <h3>Oracle</h3>
	  <code>
	    create database gallery2 {additional parameters};
	  </code>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b>Graphics Toolkits</b> - G2 works with <a
	href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net"
	target="_blank">NetPBM</a>, <a
	href="http://www.imagemagick.org/"
	target="_blank">ImageMagick</a> or <a href="http://php.net/gd"
	target="_blank">GD</a>.  They&rsquo;re all equally good,
	though some say that NetPBM has slightly better quality and
	that ImageMagick is slightly faster than NetPBM.  GD is the
	fastest and is compiled into PHP by default if your PHP is
	4.3.0 or more recent, however it may not have support for all
	image types (e.g. it might not have JPEG support). If the
	binaries for NetPBM and ImageMagick are installed in default,
	or standard, locations then G2 will auto-detect them during G2
	installation.  It won&rsquo;t cause any harm to enable all of
	these toolkits&#8212;in fact you&rsquo;ll get the widest file
	type support if you do so.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="installing">Installing G2 Alpha</a></h2>
    <p>
      Open up your web browser and browse to the <a href="install/" target="_guided">G2
      install directory</a>.  G2 will walk you through the process of
      validating that your system is properly configured and will set
      everything up for you.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	<b> Authenticate </b> - You will be asked to create and save a
	small text file in order to authenticate.  You may not proceed
	until you do this.  That&rsquo;s how G2 knows that you&rsquo;re authorized
	to use the installer.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> System Checks </b> - The installer checks your system to
	make sure that it will support G2.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Admin User Setup </b> - You are prompted for an
	administrator username and password. In this alpha release the
	default Admin username is set to <strong>admin</strong> and
	cannot be changed during the install process(though you can
	change it to something else later on). Type in a password and
	type it again to validate it. Then click &rsquo;Create&rsquo; to create
	the admin user for this installation of Gallery 2.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Storage Setup </b> - Read the instructions on the
	installer to set up a storage location for Gallery 2.  This is
	where G2 will store all of your images, as well as other cache
	information.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Database Setup </b> - Select your database type and enter
	your database authentication information.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Create Config File </b> - G2 will create the
	<b>config.php</b> file in your G2 directory.  This contains
	all the answers you&rsquo;ve provided in the installer and is
	necessary for G2 to function properly.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Install the Core module </b> - Here&rsquo;s where we create all
	the database tables and initial users and albums to get you
	started.  Unless something goes wrong, there&rsquo;s nothing for you
	to do here.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Install other modules </b> - G2 has lots of different
	modules that provide useful functionality.  Choose which ones
	you want to use.  You can always go to the <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin" target="_guided">Site
	Admin</a> page later on to install, activate or deactivate other
	modules, so it&rsquo;s ok to experiment here.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Check Security </b> - G2 walks you through the process of
	locking down your new <b>config.php</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Finished! </b> - Congratulations! Your Gallery 2 Alpha has
	successfully installed!
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="getting_started">Getting started with G2 Alpha</a></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
	<b> Log in </b> - Once you&rsquo;ve successfully got G2 Alpha installed, you should
	start by <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core:UserAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core:UserLogin&amp;g2_form[formName]=UserLogin&amp;g2_form[username]=admin" target="_guided">logging
	in</a> as the admin user that was created for you at install
	time.  The admin user has special privileges that you&rsquo;ll need
	in order to administer your new G2.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Activate Graphics Toolkits </b> - Click on the <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin" target="_guided">Site
	Admin</a> link then the <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core:AdminModules"
	target="_guided">Modules</a> link to see the module list.
	Install, configure and activate one of the NetPBM,
	ImageMagick, or GD modules.  You can activate as many of them
	as you want (more is better, here).
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Add photos </b> - Browse back to <a
	href="main.php" target="_guided">the top of your new G2</a>
	and click on the <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core:ItemAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core:ItemAdd&amp;g2_itemId=6"
	target="_guided">Add Items</a> link.  This will bring up a
	page with a few different upload options (at least 3, more if
	you have other upload modules installed).  Select the one you
	want and try adding a new photo to your album.  If all goes
	well, you should see the new photos in your <a href="main.php"
	target="_guided">Gallery!</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Add an album </b> - You don't want to put all of your
	images into the top level of your G2, so you should try
	creating a new album.  Browse back to <a href="main.php"
	target="_guided">the top of your new G2</a> and click on the
	<a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core:ItemAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core:ItemAddAlbum&amp;g2_itemId=6"
	target="_guided">add sub-album</a> link from the left side of
	the page.  This will give you a form where you can enter
	information about the new album you want to create.  Fill it
	out and click the <b>Create</b> button.  Now try adding images
	to that album instead, or select the <b>Move Photo</b> link
	from under any of the images you added earlier and move them
	into this new album.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Import Gallery 1.x albums </b> - you can easily import
	albums from Gallery 1.x (G1).  It won&rsquo;t cause any harm
	to your G1 (or at least, it&rsquo;s not supposed to).  Just go
	to the <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin&amp;g2_subView=migrate:SelectGallery"
	target="_guided">Migration Page</a> and enter the path to your
	G1 albums directory and then follow the instructions.

      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Plenty to do and see! </b> -
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Explore the different <a
	    href="main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin"
	    target="_guided">Site Admin</a> options and tune your G2
	    the way that you want it.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    You can <a
	    href="main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core:AdminLayouts"
	    target="_guided">activate different layouts</a> and then
	    experiment with layouts and themes.  You can use different
	    layouts and themes on each album!
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    You can <a
	    href="main.php?g2_view=search:SearchScan&amp;g2_form[useDefaultSettings]=1"
	    target="_guided">search your G2</a> and view the <a
	    href="main.php?g2_view=members:MembersList"
	    target="_guided">members list</a>.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    If the <b>Ffmpeg</b> module is activated, you can upload movies
	    and it will automatically create thumbnails of them for
	    you.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Activate the <b>Panorama</b> module and then try uploading
	    really wide images and then edit them to put them in
	    Panorama mode to activate the panorama viewer.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Activate the <b>Cart</b> and <b>Photoaccess</b> modules,
	    add all the photos from an album to the cart and try
	    printing them all at once (you can cancel the print job at
	    the last second so it&rsquo;s ok to play around with this)
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Activate the <b>Cart</b> and <b>Zip Download</b> modules, add
	    all the photos from an album to the cart and then download
	    them all at once as a zip file!
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <a
	    href="main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core:AdminUsers"
	    target="_guided">Create some new users</a> then <a

	    target="_guided">create some new groups</a> and then try
	    adding users to groups.  You can assign permissions to
	    entire groups instead of individual users, which makes
	    permission management much easier.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Try uploading a Shockwave or a Director file.  You can
	    view them in-line.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Activate the <b>Thumbnail Manager</b> module then try uploading an
	    MP3 and see that it&rsquo;s got a custom thumbnail. Use the <a
	    href="main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin&amp;g2_subView=thumbnail:ThumbnailSiteAdmin"
	    target="_guided">thumbnail manager</a> to upload your own
	    custom thumbnails for different file types.  G2 lets you
	    upload files of any type!
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Activate the <b>ImageBlock</b> module and see random
	    images appear in the sidebar when you browse through your
	    G2.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Play around with the <a
	    href="main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core:AdminModules"
	    target="_guided">other modules</a> and see what they do!
	    There are over 28 different cool modules that do all kinds

	    Migration seems to abort after 5 minutes so if you do a

	<b>Performance</b> - This alpha release is much faster than

    <h2><a name="updating">Updating your Gallery 2 Installation</a></h2>
    <p>
      Until G2 hits beta, you <i>may</i> have to discard your current
      G2 data any time you upgrade.  The proper way to upgrade is to
      <a href="#get_latest_code">get the latest code</a> and overwrite
      your existing copy with it.  If you see weird errors, then
      it&rsquo;s time to delete your database.  Starting with Alpha-4,
      you should be able to upgrade to future versions of Gallery 2.
      However, we're still working the kinks out of the upgrade
      process so <b>we reserve the right to screw up horribly</b>
      between now and beta.

      We sneaky developer types have a back-door that lets us do
      reinstalls much faster.  You can play with this too, but we ask

      The back door is to go to the <a href="lib/tools/test/" target="_guided">old test
      harness</a> and run the ReInitializeGallery test.  This will
      <b>immediately</b> nuke your entire G2 from orbit (it&rsquo;s the only
      way to be sure) and start all over again.  Be careful, we warned
      you.  <i>Note</i> - the ReInitializeGallery test may insert some
      strange default paths into your G2 since they&rsquo;re useful to our
      developers.  You can delete them.

    <p>
      <b> Unit Tests </b> - G2 was designed using <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.google.com/search?q=extreme+programming">Extreme
      Programming</a> methodologies.  This means that we have a ton of unit
      tests that help us make sure that the code is behaving as it should.  If
      you want to help us out, you can <a href="lib/tools/phpunit/"
      target="_guided">try running the unit tests</a> and report back
      to us if any of them fail.  <i> Note </i> - these tests
      shouldn&rsquo;t change your G2 settings at all, but if they fail, they
      may leave things in a weird state.  Be warned that you might
      have to ditch your G2 data and start over if something
      catastrophic happens.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Test Harness </b> - We also have an <a
      href="lib/tools/test/" target="_guided">older test harness</a> that
      we use to do some load testing type tasks that might be fun to
      experiment with.  Try creating 1000 users or a random tree of
      5,000 photos to see what it&rsquo;s like.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Localization </b> - If you&rsquo;re interested in localizing
      G2 into another language, you can <a
      href="lib/tools/reports/localization.php"
      target="_guided">review the current state of localization</a>
      and then <a href="docs/LOCALIZING" target="_guided">read the
      localization how-to</a> and get started.  <a
      href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=582564&amp;group_id=7130&amp;func=browse"
      target="_guided">Submit your localizations</a> early and often -
      no need to wait until you&rsquo;re entirely done.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> For Developers </b> - We've gotten started on some <a
      href="http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=GalleryDocs&amp;file=index&amp;page=gallery2-devguide.php">documentation</a>
      that you should read if you want to start hacking on G2.  It's
      an early draft and is a little bit out of date, but it's a
      start.
