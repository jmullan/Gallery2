      Welcome to Gallery 2. This is the first official release
      of Gallery 2.0, code named &ldquo;<b>Unpossible!</b>&rdquo;.
      Please read through this document carefully
      before installing Gallery 2 and before asking for help.  We have
      taken care to try to answer as many of your questions here as
      possible.  If you don't read this and have problems, we may
      refer you back to this document as a first resource.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="quick_start">Quick Start</a></h2>
    <p>
      If you&rsquo;re impatient like us, you just want to get going.
      The odds are that your system is all set to handle Gallery 2 so just skip
      right to the <a href="install/index.php" target="_guided">installer</a>
      and start clicking.  It should walk you through everything you need to
      get going.  Before you do that though, you really should read the
      <a href="#when_to_use">When should I use it?</a> section.  If you hit
      a snag, please come back here and read more before asking questions!  Enjoy.

    <p>
      Gallery is a web based software product that lets you manage
      your photos on your own website.  You must have your own website
      with PHP support in order to install and use it.  With Gallery
      you can easily create and maintain albums of photos via an
      intuitive interface.  Photo management includes automatic
      thumbnail creation, image resizing, rotation, ordering,
      captioning, searching and more.  Albums and photos can have
      view, edit, delete and other permissions per individual
      authenticated user for an additional level of privacy.  It's
      great for communities - give accounts to your friends and family
      and let them upload and manage their own photos on your website!

      Gallery 2 is a stable and secure environment for you to store
      your photos online and share them with your friends.  Use it to
      manage all of your media with confidence.  It is reliable,
      modular, portable and intuitive.

      <h3>Warning!</h3>
      <span>
	While Gallery 2 has not yet been subjected to a rigorous
	security audit, it has been widely used for over a year during
	the alpha, beta and release candidates phases.  Only minor
	security flaws have been identified during this time, and they
	were quickly addressed.  We take security very seriously, so
	if you find a security flaw, do not hesitate to email us at:
      </span>

    <h2><a name="whats_new">What&rsquo;s new in this release?</a></h2>
    <p class="toc-link"> <a href="#toc">[table of contents]</a> </p>

    <p>
      Over three years of design and development have gone into making
      Gallery 2 the best online photo management product available.
      We have made it easy to add new features while keeping them in
      separate modules so that you can customize it to only have the
      ones that you want.  For those of you who like standards, we
      have strict XHTML compliance but give plenty of power to our
      themes so that you can make it look the way that you want.  It's
      a powerful application and you're in the driver's seat.

	    fields module is active.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Restricted permissions are now set for imported photos and
	    albums from G1 that are hidden.  Gallery 2 does not yet
	    have a hidden feature so for now these items are
	    restricted by permissions.

	to better support right-to-left languages.  Gallery 2 now has 29 available
	locales; over 90% translated in 6 languages, over 50% in 7 and partially
	translated in 16 more!  We still bundle all language data with the modules..

    <ol id="beta4-list" style="display:none">
      <li>
	<b> New Theme System </b> - You spoke -- we listened.  The old
	layout and theme system was far too complicated so we've
	completely overhauled it leaving control firmly in the hands
	of the theme designer while keeping it simple and easy to work
	with.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Square Thumbnails </b> - This module now offers a mode to fit thumbnails
	inside a square with a specified background color instead of cropping the image
	into a square.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> CMYK Jpegs </b> - ImageMagick module can now detect jpegs using CMYK
	colorspace and convert to RGB for display in the Gallery, still keeping the
	original file available for download.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Multisite Support </b> - The multisite system has been
	completely redesigned and is now compatible with both URL
	Rewrite module and embedded Gallery 2.  Multisite Gallery 2
	refers to multiple independent sites using a single codebase.

      <li>
	<b> Localization </b> - The installer and upgrader can now be localized.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Improved Installer </b> - The installer offers now a clean install option,
	catches version mismatches between database/g2data/code, detects the proper
	locking system to use, and has a more detailed admin user setup.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Improved Upgrader </b> - There&rsquo;s now a progress bar in the module upgrade
	step to combat server timeouts.

	<b> Improved Cookie Management </b> - New optional
	configuration parameters enable cookie support in embedded
	Gallery 2 while maintaining maximum security by default and
	the flexibility to support embedded Gallery 2 installs on
	separate subdomains.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Colorpacks </b> - Now that layouts are gone and there are
	only themes, colorpacks let you change the color scheme of a
	theme.

	Many, many bugs fixed.

	  <li>
	    New Iconpack module adds icons for various links.

      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Layouts </b>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Simplified the PHP code required for a layout.  This makes
	    it easier to create a new layout that mostly involves
	    building the tpl files, but still allows use of additional
	    PHP code for more advanced layouts.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Standard $user template variable now available in all views, which makes
	    it easier to customize content for guests, registered users or administrators.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Hotlinked image protection </b>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    URL Rewrite module now offers the ability to restrict item downloads from
	    external referers not on an approved list.  This prevents other websites
	    from directly linking to images on your server.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Watermark module offers an alternate rule in Rewrite module which can apply
	    a watermark on the fly to images for external referers.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Tree view </b> - Album Select module now offers a dynamic tree view
	in addition to the simple select box for navigating to any album.

	<b> IPTC </b> - Support for reading IPTC data added to EXIF/IPTC module.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Forgot Password </b> - New system to reset the password for any Gallery 2 user with
	an email address.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Short URLs </b> - More control in Site Admin over how short URLs are constructed.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Owner Permissions </b> - Permissions are now transferred to the new owner
	when changing the owner of an album or item.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Updated Albums </b> - Modification date of albums now updated for item add,
	move, delete in that album (so New Items module will show "Updated").
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Add From Web </b> - Improved support for URLs where extension doesn't
	match the actual mime type (like Gallery 2 URLs!).
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Email Test </b> - Added ability to send a test email from Site Admin to
	verify email settings are correct.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> System Maintenance </b> - New maintenance tasks:
	<ul>
	  <li> Reset view counts for all albums and photos. </li>
	  <li> Build all thumbnails and resizes at once. </li>
	  <li> Display system information, useful for copy/paste to support forum. </li>
	  <li> Rewrite module task to check for conflicts between short URLs
	       and actual Gallery files. </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Integrations </b> - Improved support for integration with
	external applications.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Installer </b> - Verify that the database user has the
	correct permissions before installing.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Performance Improvements </b>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Automatic fast download code for publicly visible images.
	    We bypass most of the framework and render thumbnails and
	    resizes quickly on demand, while still preserving the
	    complete image firewall.  This radically reduces server
	    load.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Replaced the permissions table with access control lists.
	    This change isn't visible to the end user, but results in
	    a significant performance increase for large galleries.

	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Themes/CSS </b>
	<ul>
	  <li>

    </h3>
    <ol id="alpha4-list" style="display:none">
      <li>
	<b> Upgradeable Core and Modules </b> - At long last we
	support upgrading from one version of Gallery 2 to the next.
	Unfortunately, this may not work reliably for all version
	before Alpha 4, so we recommend that you reinstall Alpha 4
	from scratch just to be sure.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Module Uninstall </b> - You can now completely uninstall a
	module and then delete it from your Gallery 2 installation.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Installer Improvements </b>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The interface for installing modules is now much easier to
	    use.  It shows you all the modules and lets you select the
	    ones you want to install, and lets you repeat the process
	    as often as you like.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Added better instructions and examples for several steps
	    that were confusing (your user feedback at work!)
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The installer now works on browsers that don't allow
	    cookies.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> User Interface enhancements </b> - Some changes in our
	main layout place the most important system links on top of
	every page (Site Admin, Login, Logout, ...). This gives you
	easy access to these commands. The sidebar has some improved
	functionality, like a direct login form and some more details
	on your cart and members (if those modules are active). This
	is another step towards a "block" system where modules can
	provide any amount of blocks of information to be placed in
	the sidebar.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Navigation </b> - It's now easier to navigate around Gallery.
	Meaningful "back" links will bring you back to the last
	visited pages, e.g. it's now possible to visit the Site Admin
	while editing an album and have an easy way to return.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Random Highlight </b> - New module allows albums to
	periodically change highlight, selecting randomly from
	the album's items.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> WebCam </b> - New module creates items that
	periodically refresh the image from an external URL.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Thumbnail Page </b> - New module gives more control
	over thumbnails for movies and documents.  For multipage
	documents (like PDF/Postscript) or images (like multiscene
	TIFF) you can pick the page number for the thumbnail (Note:
	PDF/Postscript require both ImageMagick and Ghostscript).
	When used in conjunction with the Ffmpeg module you can
	pick a time offset for generating thumbnails for movies.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Graphics Toolkits </b> -
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The ImageMagick and NetPBM toolkits have been optimized
	    to make fewer calls to external binaries when used for
	    multiple operations.  For example, cropping and resizing
	    to make a thumbnail now requires only a single call to
	    "convert" with ImageMagick.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    We now preserve extra operations (like crop settings) on
	    thumbnails when moving an item between albums or
	    rebuilding thumbnails.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Added ability to set toolkit priority.  This means you
	    can activate multiple toolkits to support more mime types
	    but still select which toolkit is used in cases where
	    multiple toolkits support the same type.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Added support for ImageMagick 6.1.x
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Sort Order </b> - "Default sort order" and "Manual sort
	order" are now separate choices, allowing albums to properly
	inherit the site default for sort order; Ascending/descending
	is disabled for these choices.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> New Items </b> - New module shows "new" and "updated"
	images next to appropriate images and albums, and adds a new
	sort where new items are shown first followed by other items
	sorted by view count.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> SMTP Authentication </b> - We now support sending email
	via a SMTP server that requires user authentication.  Any
	module that sends email (like the registration module) can
	take advantage of this support.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Embedding Gallery 2 </b> - We've made great improvements in
	embedding Gallery 2 into other applications.  We've
	successfully (though not completely) embedded it into Xaraya
	and have begun working on other platforms.  There's now a
	rudimentary <a href="docs/EMBEDDING">document</a> to
	explain how to do it.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Thumbnail Creation </b> - We now let you create thumbnails
	at upload time, which greatly improves performance the first
	time you view an album.  It's optional, but on by default.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Improved Error Pages </b> - We now show you a nice error
	page when two simultaneous and conflicting changes happen.
	This new page explains how to resolve the problem.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Members </b> - We now show a list of the recent
	changes that a user has made, and let you page through the
	entire list of changes.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Removed IE7 </b> - We were experimenting with <a
	href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/" target="_blank">IE7</a>,
	a compatibility layer in JavaScript reduces some of the
	incompatibilities between IE6 and other browsers.  However we
	were not able to get the performance and reliability that we
	needed so we've decided to abandon using it (at least for now).
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Localization </b> - Gallery 2 is now translated into 18 languages, though only
	German, Danish and Swedish are over 50% translated.  We can
	use your help!
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Bug fixes </b> - Many bugs closed!
      </li>
    </ol>

    </h3>
    <ol id="alpha3-list" style="display:none">
      <li>
	<b> Watermark Support </b> - We now support image
	watermarking.  You can add a watermark to the thumbnail,
	resize or full sized version of an image using a DHTML
	drag-and-drop interface.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Oracle Database Support </b> - The installer now offers
	Oracle (version 9i and higher) among the supported database types.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Module Manifests </b> - All modules now come with a
	manifest file, and the installer checks to make sure that
	you&rsquo;ve got a complete set of files on the server.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Auto Completion </b> - the Site Admin user and groups
	pages, and the permissions pages now perform appropriate
	completion for you.  Just type a few characters of the
	username you&rsquo;re searching for and it&rsquo;ll give you up to 10
	possible matches.  Tested on Firefox, but not extensively
	tested on IE yet.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> New version of IE7 </b> - We&rsquo;re experimenting with <a
	href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/" target="_blank">IE7</a>,
	a compatibility layer in JavaScript reduces some of the
	incompatibilities between IE6 and other browsers.  The older
	version caused weird problems with images getting overlaid
	with a red X, or IE6 crashing.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Migration improvements </b> -
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    We now properly migrate item owners
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    We now preserve the order of imported subalbums
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Gallery 1 summary and description fields are now
	    transposed on import so that the Gallery 1 "summary"
	    (which was shown inside the album itself) is now the
	    Gallery 2 "description" and vice versa.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> CMS Integration </b> - Although this is not yet readily visible, a
	great deal of work has been done on getting Gallery 2 ready to integrate into
	external content management systems.  We&rsquo;ve successfully done partial
	integrations with <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.xaraya.com/">Xaraya</a> and <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, with more on the way.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Square Thumbnails </b> - We fixed a noticeable bug where
	the first time you viewed a square thumbnail it might appear
	distorted (this was mentioned in the "known bugs" list of the
	alpha-2 release).
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Zip Cart Plugin </b> - You can now download the contents
	of your cart as a zip file.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> User Albums </b> - You can use the new User Albums module
	to automatically create a new album for a user whenever you
	create a new user.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Installer </b> - Many minor tweaks including adding more
	install checks to make sure that your system is OK.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Members </b> - The members module now has privacy settings
	so that you can prevent the unauthorized from seeing your list
	of members, and/or their email addresses.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Bug fixes </b> - Many bugs closed!

 <h2><a name="packages">Choosing a package</a></h2>
    <p class="toc-link"> <a href="#toc">[table of contents]</a> </p>
    <p>
      You can choose from four different packages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<b>Minimal</b> - The base application, 2 themes and 3 graphics toolkits.
	Everything you need to publish photos, and nothing more.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Typical</b> - The base application, 6 themes and a selection of popular
	modules.  Enough to satisfy the demands of most Gallery users.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Full</b> - The base application, 6 themes and 46 modules.  Every cool
	feature we've got.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Developer</b> - Same as the full package, except it includes all the
	developer tools so that you can work on improving the code.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You get to pick and choose which modules you activate, so even if you download
      a package that has more modules than you need you can always choose not to
      activate the ones you don't want.  You can also activate a module and test it
      out for a while, then later deactivate and deinstall it.  You can also delete
      any modules/themes that you're not using if you want to save space.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of our modules and themes are available separately so if you install a
      smaller package and then later on decide that you want to add more
      functionality you can download just the modules/themes that you want and install
      them yourself.

	<b><a name="get_latest_code">Latest Version</a></b> -
	There are three ways to get the code.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <b>Tarball</b> - You can download a prepackaged file as a
	    tarball or a zip file from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gallery/"
	      target="_blank">SourceForge</a>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <b>Nightly Snapshot</b> - You can download a tarball or zip file with
	    a snapshot of the most recent code.  Find links to these on the
	    <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/wiki/Download"
	       target="_blank">Gallery Download Page</a>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <b>CVS</b> - This is a better way to get the latest code,
	    but it&rsquo;s for <i>advanced</i> users.  Follow the <a
	      href="http://gallery.menalto.com/wiki/DownloadingGalleryUsingCVS"
	      target="_blank">CVS instructions</a> to obtain the latest Gallery 2
	    code.  It&rsquo;s easier to stay up to date with this method since
	    you can run one command and get the latest code at any time.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b>Storage</b> - Create a directory for gallery to store
	photos.  This must be writeable by the web server, but for
	security reasons we suggest that you do not put it in the web
	root.  If you put it in the web root, then anybody can get
	directly to your images with their web browser which
	circumvents Gallery 2&rsquo;s security.
	<div class="instructions">
	  <h3>Unix Example</h3>
	  <p>
	    $ cd $HOME <br/>
	    $ mkdir g2data <br/>
	    $ chmod 777 g2data
	  </p>
	</div>

	<div class="instructions">
	  <h3>Windows Example</h3>
	  <p>
	    C:\> mkdir g2data
	  </p>
	</div>

	In the Unix example, you may note that modes of 777 on your
	<strong>g2data</strong> directory are not all that secure.  However, making it
	more secure depends on how your system is configured.  Talk
	with your system administrator about ways to change the
	permissions on that directory to make it so that Gallery can
	still write to the files but that others can&rsquo;t.

	<b>Graphics Toolkits</b> - Gallery 2 works with <a
	href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net"
	target="_blank">NetPBM</a>, <a
	href="http://www.imagemagick.org/"
	target="_blank">ImageMagick</a>, <a href="http://php.net/gd"
	target="_blank">GD</a> or <a
	href="http://www.graphicsmagick.org/"
	target="_blank">GraphicsMagick</a>.  They&rsquo;re all almost
	equally good, though some say that NetPBM has slightly better
	quality and that ImageMagick is slightly faster than
	NetPBM. GD cannot do image rotation.  GraphicsMagick and
	ImageMagick are very similar. GD can be very fast, but it will
	also use a lot of memory so it may cause you to run into
	predefined server limits.  It is also compiled into PHP by
	default if your PHP is 4.3.0 or more recent, however it may
	not have support for all image types (e.g. it might not have
	JPEG support). If the binaries for NetPBM and ImageMagick are
	installed in default, or standard, locations then Gallery 2
	will auto-detect them during installation.  It won&rsquo;t cause any harm to
	enable all of these toolkits&#8212;in fact you&rsquo;ll get the widest file type
	support if you do so.

    <h2><a name="installing">Installing</a></h2>
    <p class="toc-link"> <a href="#toc">[table of contents]</a> </p>
    <p>
      Gallery 2 is a web application and must be installed on your web
      server in order for you to use it.  If you've unpacked it on
      your desktop, you will have to upload it to your server as part
      of the install process.  Then you can configure it using your web browser.
    </p>
    <ol style="margin-top: 0.2em">
      <li>
	<b> Upload </b> - Copy the Gallery 2 files to a directory on your webserver. There are
	several alternatives for this step:
	<ul style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0">
	  <li>
	    <b>Fastest way</b>: Upload the gallery package to your web
	    server archive via FTP or another method, then unpack it
	    using an interactive shell session (eg. ssh or telnet).
	    Example unpacking commands (choose the appropriate one):
	    <div class="instructions">
	      <h3> For .tar.gz archives </h3>
	      <p>
		$ tar xzf gallery2.tar.gz
	      </p>
	    </div>

	    <div class="instructions">
	      <h3> For zip archives </h3>
	      <p>
		$ unzip gallery2.zip
	      </p>
	    </div>

	    If you do not have shell access, you can ask your provider
	    to do it for you, or you can make a miniature PHP script
	    containing one of the above commands.  Some webhosting
	    companies offer a control panel with a web file-browser
	    which is capable of extracting / unarchiving archive
	    files. It&rsquo;s worth a try to check if this option is
	    available.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <b>Easiest (but slowest) way:</b> If you don't have shell
	    access, you can upload the complete contents of the
	    Gallery 2 archive to the webserver with an FTP
	    program. This may take a lot of time and be
	    error-prone. In this case, pay special attention to the
	    &rsquo;System Checks&rsquo; step of the installer and make
	    sure that there are no missing or modified files.
	    Consider using a smart FTP program like <a
	    href="http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/">FileZilla</a> to
	    make sure that your transfer goes smoothly.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <b>Advanced way</b>: The best way to install Gallery
	    <b>and</b> stay up to date if you have shell access to
	    your webserver is to use CVS.
	    <div class="instructions">
	      <p>
		$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/gallery login
		<br/>
		&nbsp;<i> (if it asks for a password, just hit enter) </i>
		<br/>
		$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/gallery co gallery2
	      </p>
	    </div>
	    SourceForge's CVS connection can be slow at times.  But
	    this approach is great because any time you want to update
	    your Gallery install all you have to do is do:
	    <div class="instructions">
	      <p>
		$ cd gallery2 <br/>
		$ cvs update -Pd
	      </p>
	    </div>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<b> Note: </b> After uploading, you should close this version
	of the README and browse to the version that you just
	uploaded.  That way all the links in this document will point
	to the right places in your Gallery 2 install.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Begin Installing </b> - Open up your web browser and
	browse to the <a href="install/index.php"
	target="_guided">install directory</a>.  Gallery 2 will walk
	you through the process of validating that your system is
	properly configured and will set everything up for you.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Authenticate </b> - You will be asked to create and save a
	small text file in order to authenticate.  You may not proceed
	until you do this.  That&rsquo;s how Gallery 2 knows that you&rsquo;re authorized
	to use the installer.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> System Checks </b> - The installer checks your system to
	make sure that it will support Gallery 2. Make sure that all
	checks are successful!
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Installation Type </b> - Gallery can support multiple independent sites with
	a single installation of the code.  Here you will select a standard single install
	or the location of a new multisite install. There is more information about multisite
	in the <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/index.php/Gallery2:Multisite"
	target="_blank">Gallery Codex</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Storage Setup </b> - Read the instructions on the
	installer to set up a storage location for Gallery 2.  This is
	where Gallery 2 will store all of your images, as well as other cache
	information.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Database Setup </b> - Select your database type and enter
	your database authentication information. If this is not your first Gallery 2 installation
	and there are still some remains of the old installation, it will check the state of the
	installed version and offer a clean install option which will delete all your data in the
	storage directory and in the database. If the installed version  seems to be fine, it will
	also offer to reuse the existing database tables. Select this option if you did not start
	the installer with the intent to start from scratch.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Admin User Setup </b> - You are prompted for an
	administrator username and password. Type in a password and
	type it again to validate it. The full name and the email address are optional.
	But entering an email address is highly recommended. Once you&rsquo;re finished,
	 click &rsquo;Create&rsquo; to create the admin user for this installation of Gallery 2.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Create Config File </b> - Gallery 2 will create the
	<b>config.php</b> file in your Gallery 2 directory.  This contains
	all the answers you&rsquo;ve provided in the installer and is
	necessary for Gallery 2 to function properly. At this point, there&rsquo;s also a sanity
	check to prevent you from damaging your Gallery install by running the installer when you
	should rather have started the upgrader.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Install the Core module </b> - Here&rsquo;s where we create all
	the database tables and initial users and albums to get you
	started.  Unless something goes wrong, there&rsquo;s nothing for you
	to do here.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Install other modules </b> - Gallery 2 has lots of different
	modules that provide useful functionality.  Choose which ones
	you want to use.  You can always go to the <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core.SiteAdmin" target="_guided">Site
	Admin</a> page later on to install, activate, deactivate or
	uninstall modules, so it&rsquo;s ok to experiment here.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Check Security </b> - Gallery 2 walks you through the process of
	locking down your new <b>config.php</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Finished! </b> - Congratulations! You have successfully
	installed Gallery 2!

    <p class="toc-link"> <a href="#toc">[table of contents]</a> </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	<b>Theme upgrade</b> - In beta-4 all layouts have been replaced with the new
	theme system.  During the upgrade process the layout setting on all albums
	is cleared and the site-wide default theme is set to matrix.  You'll have to
	reselect the default theme and any album specific settings to restore the
	layout configuration in place prior to this upgrade.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Performance</b> - There are still some tweaks that we can make to have it go faster,
	stay tuned!
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Login Problems</b> - Before beta-4 there were known login / session problems.
	As a consequence of our fix for this problem, you and all your Gallery users have to
	delete old GALLERYSID cookie(s) in your browser if Gallery seems to ignore login requests.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>View names</b> - In beta-4 the naming convention for views changed from using
	a colon separator to a period (core:ShowItem is now core.ShowItem).  All Gallery
	code has been updated but there are a few places you should check to make sure
	your site is up to date:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Local tpl files: make sure to update all view names in your customized
	    templates.  Compare to the current version of the default tpls if needed.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    External imageblock: update imageblock:External to imageblock.External in
	    any uses of this feature.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    PublishXP: Select 'add items' / Windows XP and follow the directions to
	    update your registry so it will reflect the new view name.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

	<b>Multisite config.php</b> - The multisite system changed in beta-4 and old style
	multisite config.php files are no longer supported.  Follow these steps to move
	your sites to the new system:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Replace any symlinks created for multisite support with real directories
	    and/or remove any .htaccess files that were setup to redirect requests
	    from a multisite directory to the Gallery 2 codebase.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Examine your config.php file and learn the basics of its structure.  You
	    will find multiple complete single configurations that each start with
	    <tt>&lt;?php</tt> and end with <tt>?&gt;</tt>, with some additional content
	    above, below and between these sections.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Copy each configuration in the combined file into separate single files.
	    Each new file should have <tt>&lt;?php</tt> as the very first line and
	    <tt>?&gt;</tt> as the very last line with no extra spaces or blank lines
	    at the top or bottom, and there should be only one of each of these tags.
	    Place each new single config.php in the multisite directory for that site.
	    The <tt>case 'domain/path':</tt> line just above each configuration in the
	    combined file will help you determine which config.php goes in which
	    multisite directory.  Note that this "case" line does not go in the new
	    config.php file.  The last configuration in the combined file has
	    <tt>default:</tt> just above it instead of "case".  Rename the combined
	    file to something else and put this last configuration in place as the
	    config.php in this directory.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Now access the primary site and run through the upgrader.  Make sure
	    everything is working correctly with this site.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    For each additional site follow this process: browse to install/index.php
	    of the primary site.  In step 3 enter the path to the multisite directory
	    to update.  After this step you should see some new files in the multisite
	    directory, including <tt>upgrade/index.php</tt>.  At this point <i>stop</i>
	    using the installer and browse to <tt>upgrade/index.php</tt> for this site
	    (not the primary site).  Step through the upgrader to the upgrade core module
	    step.  After the core upgrade completes manually edit the config.php for this
	    site.  At the bottom you will find a <tt>galleryBaseUrl</tt> setting.
	    Enter the URL for the primary site here, ending with a /.  For example,
	    <tt>http://mydomain.com/gallery2/</tt> or <tt>http://photos.mydomain.com/</tt>.
	    Note this is the URL for the primary site, not the site you are currently
	    upgrading.  Save this change and finish the remaining steps of the upgrader.
	    Make sure this site now works correctly.

      <b> Unit Tests </b> - Gallery 2 was designed using <a
	target="_blank"
	href="http://www.google.com/search?q=extreme+programming">Extreme
	Programming</a> methodologies.  This means that we have a ton of
      unit tests that help us make sure that the code is behaving as
      it should.  If you want to help us out, you can <a
	href="lib/tools/phpunit/index.php" target="_guided">try running
	the unit tests</a> and report back to us if any of them fail.
      <br/>
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px">
      <b> Note </b> - these tests shouldn&rsquo;t change your Gallery
      2 settings at all, but if they fail, they may leave things in a
      weird state.  Be warned that there's a slim chance that you
      might have to ditch your Gallery 2 data and start over if
      something catastrophic happens.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> For Themers </b> - There is now some <a
      href="http://codex.gallery2.org/index.php/Gallery2:Themes">theme documentation</a>
      that you should read if you want to change the look of your Gallery 2 by customizing
      an existing theme and its templates or by creating your own theme.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Localization </b> - If you&rsquo;re interested in localizing
      Gallery 2 into another language, you can <a
      href="lib/tools/reports/localization.php"
      target="_guided">review the current state of localization</a>
      and then <a href="docs/LOCALIZING" target="_guided">read the
      localization how-to</a> and get started.  <a
      href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=582564&amp;group_id=7130&amp;func=browse"
      target="_guided">Submit your localizations</a> early and often -
      no need to wait until you&rsquo;re entirely done.

      <b> For Developers </b> - We've gotten started on some <a
      href="http://gallery.menalto.com/wiki/Development_Documents">
      developer documentation</a> that you should read if you want to start hacking on
      Gallery 2.  Some of the information is a little bit out of date or in early drafts,
      but it's a start.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Embedding </b> - See this <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/node/24126">forum topic</a>
      for the status of the integration modules to embed Gallery 2 in various applications.
      This <a href="docs/EMBEDDING">documentation</a> explains how to setup an integrated
      environment or build the integration module for a new application.
