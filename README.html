    <h2><a name="what_is_gallery">What is Gallery?</a></h2>
    <p>
      Gallery is a web based software product that lets you manage
      your photos on your own website.  You must have your own website
      with PHP support in order to install and use it.  With Gallery
      you can easily create and maintain albums of photos via an
      intuitive interface.  Photo management includes automatic
      thumbnail creation, image resizing, rotation, ordering,
      captioning, searching and more.  Albums and photos can have
      read, write, caption and other permissions per individual
      authenticated user for an additional level of privacy.  Give
      accounts to your friends and family and let them upload and
      manage their own photos on your website!
    </p>

    <h2><a name="what_is_g2">What is Gallery 2 Beta?</a></h2>
    <p>
      A Beta release is the second official round of releases of a
      product.  A Beta release can sometimes be unstable, contains
      both known and unknown bugs.  Generally, almost all of the
      features of the final product will be present.  We release it
      early so that you can see what is coming and give us feedback
      that will help us improve the final release.

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="when_to_use">When to use Gallery 2 Beta</a></h2>
    <p>
      You should install Gallery 2 Beta to try it out.  You could
      install it next to your production version of Gallery 1 in a
      hidden directory.  You could install it on a development server.
      We want you to try it, test it, break it, and tell us all about
      it.  Get your friends and colleagues to poke around.  You can
      use the migration module to import some or all of your Gallery 1
      albums into Gallery 2 for test purposes (this shouldn&rsquo;t
      affect your Gallery 1 installation at all).
    </p>

    <h2><a name="when_not_to_use">When not to use Gallery 2 Beta</a></h2>
    <p>
      Do not use it as the main repository for your data.  Do not use
      it for a production web site.  Although we provide an upgrade
      path <b>we will not provide the same level of support for
      Gallery 2 that we provide for Gallery 1</b> until we get to
      release candidates.  We know that Gallery 2 is much better than
      Gallery 1, and it may be tempting to just replace your Gallery 1
      with it.  But we're still making plenty of changes and mistakes
      happen so if you use it in production, be prepared to dig into
      it yourself and fix things if they break.
    </p>

    <div class="important">
      <h3>Warning!</h3>
      <span>
	Gallery 2 has not yet been subjected to a rigorous security
	audit!  While we have taken great pains to make sure that it
	is secure, there is still the chance that there are some big
	security holes in it that might cause you trouble.  If you
	find a security flaw, do not hesitate to email us at:
      </span>

    </div>

    <h2><a name="whats_new">What&rsquo;s new in Gallery 2 Beta</a></h2>

    <p>
      Gallery 2 has been redesigned from the ground up and is database
      driven! It is secure, scalable, reliable, modular, customizable,
      portable and intuitive. In short, we looked at all the things we
      did wrong in Gallery 1 and we did them again the right way. Two
      and a half years of design and development have gone into
      Gallery 2. It&rsquo;s got customizable themes and layouts using
      XHTML compliant templates which makes it much easier for you to
      personalize your Gallery 2 install. All the cool bells and
      whistles are in modules that can be enabled separately for
      maximum control.

    </h3>
    <ol id="beta4-list">
      <li>
	<b> Square Thumbnails </b> - This module now offers a mode to fit thumbnails
	inside a square with a specified background color instead of cropping the image
	into a square.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Multisite Support </b> - The multisite system has been completely
	redesigned and is now compatible with both URL Rewrite module and embedded G2.
	Multisite G2 refers to multiple independent sites using a single codebase.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Localization </b> - The installer and upgrader can now be localized.

    <ol id="beta3-list" style="display:none">
      <li>
	<b> New Modules </b>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    New Quotas module allows limiting disk usage for users and groups.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    New Iconpack module adds icons for various links.
	  </li>
	  <li>

      <li>
	<b> Layouts </b>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Simplified the PHP code required for a layout.  This makes
	    it easier to create a new layout that mostly involves
	    building the tpl files, but still allows use of additional
	    PHP code for more advanced layouts.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Standard $user template variable now available in all views, which makes
	    it easier to customize content for guests, registered users or administrators.

      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Hotlinked image protection </b>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    URL Rewrite module now offers the ability to restrict item downloads from
	    external referers not on an approved list.  This prevents other websites
	    from directly linking to images on your server.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Watermark module offers an alternate rule in Rewrite module which can apply
	    a watermark on the fly to images for external referers.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Tree view </b> - Album Select module now offers a dynamic tree view

	size to any item or album, not just for photo thumbnails.

      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Forgot Password </b> - New system to reset the password for any Gallery 2 user with
	an email address.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Short URLs </b> - More control in Site Admin over how short URLs are constructed.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Owner Permissions </b> - Permissions are now transferred to the new owner
	when changing the owner of an album or item.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Updated Albums </b> - Modification date of albums now updated for item add,
	move, delete in that album (so New Items module will show "Updated").
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Add From Web </b> - Improved support for URLs where extension doesn't
	match the actual mime type (like Gallery 2 URLs!).
      </li>

	<b> Email Test </b> - Added ability to send a test email from Site Admin to
	verify email settings are correct.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> System Maintenance </b> - New maintenance tasks:
	<ul>
	  <li> Reset view counts for all albums and photos. </li>
	  <li> Build all thumbnails and resizes at once. </li>
	  <li> Display system information, useful for copy/paste to support forum. </li>
	  <li> Rewrite module task to check for conflicts between short URLs
	       and actual Gallery files. </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Integrations </b> - Improved support for integration with
	external applications.
      </li>
      <li>

	    Automatic fast download code for publicly visible images.

	    complete image firewall.  This radically reduces server
	    load.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Replaced the permissions table with access control lists.
	    This change isn't visible to the end user, but results in

	    Hybrid, slider and tile layouts are now themeable and have
	    improved cross browser compatibility.

    </h3>
    <ol id="alpha4-list" style="display:none">
      <li>
	<b> Upgradeable Core and Modules </b> - At long last we
	support upgrading from one version of Gallery 2 to the next.
	Unfortunately, this may not work reliably for all version
	before Alpha 4, so we recommend that you reinstall Alpha 4
	from scratch just to be sure.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Module Uninstall </b> - You can now completely uninstall a
	module and then delete it from your Gallery 2 installation.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Installer Improvements </b>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The interface for installing modules is now much easier to
	    use.  It shows you all the modules and lets you select the
	    ones you want to install, and lets you repeat the process
	    as often as you like.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Added better instructions and examples for several steps
	    that were confusing (your user feedback at work!)
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The installer now works on browsers that don't allow
	    cookies.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> User Interface enhancements </b> - Some changes in our
	main layout place the most important system links on top of
	every page (Site Admin, Login, Logout, ...). This gives you
	easy access to these commands. The sidebar has some improved
	functionality, like a direct login form and some more details
	on your cart and members (if those modules are active). This
	is another step towards a "block" system where modules can
	provide any amount of blocks of information to be placed in
	the sidebar.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Navigation </b> - It's now easier to navigate around Gallery.
	Meaningful "back" links will bring you back to the last
	visited pages, e.g. it's now possible to visit the Site Admin
	while editing an album and have an easy way to return.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Random Highlight </b> - New module allows albums to
	periodically change highlight, selecting randomly from
	the album's items.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> WebCam </b> - New module creates items that
	periodically refresh the image from an external URL.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Thumbnail Page </b> - New module gives more control
	over thumbnails for movies and documents.  For multipage
	documents (like PDF/Postscript) or images (like multiscene
	TIFF) you can pick the page number for the thumbnail (Note:
	PDF/Postscript require both ImageMagick and Ghostscript).
	When used in conjunction with the Ffmpeg module you can
	pick a time offset for generating thumbnails for movies.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Graphics Toolkits </b> -
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The ImageMagick and NetPBM toolkits have been optimized
	    to make fewer calls to external binaries when used for
	    multiple operations.  For example, cropping and resizing
	    to make a thumbnail now requires only a single call to
	    "convert" with ImageMagick.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    We now preserve extra operations (like crop settings) on
	    thumbnails when moving an item between albums or
	    rebuilding thumbnails.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Added ability to set toolkit priority.  This means you
	    can activate multiple toolkits to support more mime types
	    but still select which toolkit is used in cases where
	    multiple toolkits support the same type.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Added support for ImageMagick 6.1.x
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Sort Order </b> - "Default sort order" and "Manual sort
	order" are now separate choices, allowing albums to properly
	inherit the site default for sort order; Ascending/descending
	is disabled for these choices.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> New Items </b> - New module shows "new" and "updated"
	images next to appropriate images and albums, and adds a new
	sort where new items are shown first followed by other items
	sorted by view count.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> SMTP Authentication </b> - We now support sending email
	via a SMTP server that requires user authentication.  Any
	module that sends email (like the registration module) can
	take advantage of this support.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Embedding Gallery 2 </b> - We've made great improvements in
	embedding Gallery 2 into other applications.  We've
	successfully (though not completely) embedded it into Xaraya
	and have begun working on other platforms.  There's now a
	rudimentary <a href="docs/EMBEDDING">document</a> to
	explain how to do it.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Thumbnail Creation </b> - We now let you create thumbnails
	at upload time, which greatly improves performance the first
	time you view an album.  It's optional, but on by default.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Improved Error Pages </b> - We now show you a nice error
	page when two simultaneous and conflicting changes happen.
	This new page explains how to resolve the problem.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Members </b> - We now show a list of the recent
	changes that a user has made, and let you page through the
	entire list of changes.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Removed IE7 </b> - We were experimenting with <a
	href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/" target="_blank">IE7</a>,
	a compatibility layer in JavaScript reduces some of the
	incompatibilities between IE6 and other browsers.  However we
	were not able to get the performance and reliability that we
	needed so we've decided to abandon using it (at least for now).
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Localization </b> - Gallery 2 is now translated into 18 languages, though only
	German, Danish and Swedish are over 50% translated.  We can
	use your help!
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Bug fixes </b> - Many bugs closed!
      </li>
    </ol>

    </h3>
    <ol id="alpha3-list" style="display:none">
      <li>
	<b> Watermark Support </b> - We now support image
	watermarking.  You can add a watermark to the thumbnail,
	resize or full sized version of an image using a DHTML
	drag-and-drop interface.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Oracle Database Support </b> - The installer now offers
	Oracle (version 9i and higher) among the supported database types.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Module Manifests </b> - All modules now come with a
	manifest file, and the installer checks to make sure that
	you&rsquo;ve got a complete set of files on the server.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Auto Completion </b> - the Site Admin user and groups
	pages, and the permissions pages now perform appropriate
	completion for you.  Just type a few characters of the
	username you&rsquo;re searching for and it&rsquo;ll give you up to 10
	possible matches.  Tested on Firefox, but not extensively
	tested on IE yet.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> New version of IE7 </b> - We&rsquo;re experimenting with <a
	href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/" target="_blank">IE7</a>,
	a compatibility layer in JavaScript reduces some of the
	incompatibilities between IE6 and other browsers.  The older
	version caused weird problems with images getting overlaid
	with a red X, or IE6 crashing.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Migration improvements </b> -
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    We now properly migrate item owners
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    We now preserve the order of imported subalbums
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Gallery 1 summary and description fields are now
	    transposed on import so that the Gallery 1 "summary"
	    (which was shown inside the album itself) is now the
	    Gallery 2 "description" and vice versa.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> CMS Integration </b> - Although this is not yet readily visible, a
	great deal of work has been done on getting Gallery 2 ready to integrate into
	external content management systems.  We&rsquo;ve successfully done partial
	integrations with <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.xaraya.com/">Xaraya</a> and <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, with more on the way.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Square Thumbnails </b> - We fixed a noticeable bug where
	the first time you viewed a square thumbnail it might appear
	distorted (this was mentioned in the "known bugs" list of the
	alpha-2 release).
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Zip Cart Plugin </b> - You can now download the contents
	of your cart as a zip file.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> User Albums </b> - You can use the new User Albums module
	to automatically create a new album for a user whenever you
	create a new user.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Installer </b> - Many minor tweaks including adding more
	install checks to make sure that your system is OK.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Members </b> - The members module now has privacy settings
	so that you can prevent the unauthorized from seeing your list
	of members, and/or their email addresses.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b> Bug fixes </b> - Many bugs closed!

    <h2><a name="prerequisites">Gallery 2 Beta Installation Prerequisites</a></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
	<b><a name="get_latest_code">Latest Version</a></b> -
	There are three ways to get the code.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <b>Tarball</b> - You can download a prepackaged file as a
	    tarball or a zip file from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gallery/"
	      target="_blank">SourceForge</a>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <b>Nightly Snapshot</b> - You can download a tarball or zip file with
	    a snapshot of the most recent code.  Find links to these on the
	    <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=phpWiki&amp;file=index&amp;pagename=Download"
	      target="_blank">Gallery Download Page</a>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <b>CVS</b> - This is a better way to get the latest code,
	    but it&rsquo;s for <i>advanced</i> users.  Follow the <a
	      href="http://gallery.sourceforge.net/wiki.php?page=DownloadingGalleryUsingCVS"
	      target="_blank">CVS instructions</a> to obtain the latest Gallery 2
	    code.  It&rsquo;s easier to stay up to date with this method since
	    you can run one command and get the latest code at any time.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>

      <li>
	<b>Storage</b> - Create a directory for gallery to store
	photos.  This must be writeable by the web server, but for
	security reasons we suggest that you do not put it in the web
	root.  If you put it in the web root, then anybody can get
	directly to your images with their web browser which
	circumvents Gallery 2&rsquo;s security.
	<div class="instructions">
	  <h3>Unix Example</h3>
	  <code>
	    $ cd $HOME <br/>
	    $ mkdir g2data <br/>
	    $ chmod 777 g2data
	  </code>
	</div>

	<div class="instructions">
	  <h3>Windows Example</h3>
	  <code>
	    C:\> mkdir g2data
	  </code>
	</div>

	In the Unix example, you may note that modes of 777 on your
	<strong>g2data</strong> directory are not all that secure.  However, making it
	more secure depends on how your system is configured.  Talk
	with your system administrator about ways to change the
	permissions on that directory to make it so that Gallery can
	still write to the files but that others can&rsquo;t.
      </li>

      <li>
	<b>Database</b> - Right now we support <a
	href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/"
	target="_blank">MySQL</a>, <a
	href="http://www.postgresql.org/mirrors-ftp.html" target=
	"_blank">PostgreSQL</a> and <a
	href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/index.html"
	target="_blank">Oracle</a>.  MySQL is generally faster than
	PostgreSQL. We require you to create the database yourself.
	In our examples below, we&rsquo;ll be creating a database called
	<b>gallery2</b>.  You can use any database name that you
	choose. <br />
	Grant all required <strong>privileges</strong> to your database user. This includes but
	is not confined to: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE in the gallery2 database;
	SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on all (gallery2) tables in the gallery2 database;
	CREATE INDEX and some other privileges that are specific to the different database
	management systems.  CREATE/DROP DATABASE and the ability to GRANT privileges to other
	database users are not required.

	href="http://www.imagemagick.org/"
	target="_blank">ImageMagick</a> or <a href="http://php.net/gd"
	target="_blank">GD</a>.  They&rsquo;re all equally good,
	though some say that NetPBM has slightly better quality and
	that ImageMagick is slightly faster than NetPBM.  GD can be
	very fast, but it will also use a lot of memory so it may
	cause you to run into predefined server limits.  It is also
	compiled into PHP by default if your PHP is 4.3.0 or more
	recent, however it may not have support for all image types
	(e.g. it might not have JPEG support). If the binaries for
	NetPBM and ImageMagick are installed in default, or standard,
	locations then Gallery 2 will auto-detect them during Gallery 2
	installation.  It won&rsquo;t cause any harm to enable all of
	these toolkits&#8212;in fact you&rsquo;ll get the widest file
	type support if you do so.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="installing">Installing Gallery 2 Beta</a></h2>
    <p>
      Gallery 2 is a web application and must be installed on your web
      server in order for you to use it.  If you've unpacked it on
      your desktop, you will have to upload it to your server as part
      of the install process, then you can configure it using your web
      browser.
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0">
      <li>
	<b> Upload </b> - Copy the Gallery 2 files to a directory on your webserver. There are
	several alternatives for this step:
	<ul style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0">
	  <li>
	    Ideally, you can use cvs to install and update your Gallery 2 installation directly
	    on the server. But this option is only available if you have command line access to
	    the server (ssh/telnet).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The next best alternative is to upload the gallery2.tar.gz or gallery2.zip archive via
	    FTP or another method. Then unarchive / extract the archive in the command line
	    (ssh/telnet) or with a miniature PHP script with the command &rsquo;tar -xzf
	    gallery2.tar.gz&rsquo; for the .tar.gz archive or &rsquo;unzip gallery2.zip&rsquo; for
	    the .zip archive. Some webhosting companies offer a control panel with a web
	    file-browser which is capable of extracting / unarchiving archive files. It&rsquo;s
	    worth a try to check if this option is available.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    If you have neither of these options, you have to upload the complete contents of the
	    Gallery 2 archive to the webserver with an FTP program. This will take a lot of time
	    and is error-prone. In this case, pay special attention to the &rsquo;System
	    Checks&rsquo; step of the installer and make sure that there are no missing or modified
	    files.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<b> Note: </b> After uploading, you should close this version
	of the README and browse to the version that you just
	uploaded.  That way all the links in this document will point
	to the right places in your Gallery 2 install.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Begin Installing </b> - Open up your web browser and
	browse to the <a href="install/index.php"
	target="_guided">install directory</a>.  Gallery 2 will walk
	you through the process of validating that your system is
	properly configured and will set everything up for you.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ol style="margin-top: 0.2em">
      <li>
	<b> Authenticate </b> - You will be asked to create and save a
	small text file in order to authenticate.  You may not proceed
	until you do this.  That&rsquo;s how Gallery 2 knows that you&rsquo;re authorized
	to use the installer.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> System Checks </b> - The installer checks your system to
	make sure that it will support Gallery 2. Make sure that all
	checks are successful!
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Multisite Setup </b> - Gallery can support multiple independent sites with
	a single installation of the code.  Here you will select a standard single install
	or the location of a new multisite install.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Admin User Setup </b> - You are prompted for an
	administrator username and password. In this beta release the
	default Admin username is set to <strong>admin</strong> and
	cannot be changed during the install process (though you can
	change it to something else later on). Type in a password and
	type it again to validate it. Then click &rsquo;Create&rsquo; to create
	the admin user for this installation of Gallery 2.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Storage Setup </b> - Read the instructions on the
	installer to set up a storage location for Gallery 2.  This is
	where Gallery 2 will store all of your images, as well as other cache
	information.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Database Setup </b> - Select your database type and enter
	your database authentication information.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Create Config File </b> - Gallery 2 will create the
	<b>config.php</b> file in your Gallery 2 directory.  This contains
	all the answers you&rsquo;ve provided in the installer and is
	necessary for Gallery 2 to function properly.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Install the Core module </b> - Here&rsquo;s where we create all
	the database tables and initial users and albums to get you
	started.  Unless something goes wrong, there&rsquo;s nothing for you
	to do here.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Install other modules </b> - Gallery 2 has lots of different
	modules that provide useful functionality.  Choose which ones
	you want to use.  You can always go to the <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core.SiteAdmin" target="_guided">Site
	Admin</a> page later on to install, activate, deactivate or
	uninstall modules, so it&rsquo;s ok to experiment here.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Check Security </b> - Gallery 2 walks you through the process of
	locking down your new <b>config.php</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Finished! </b> - Congratulations! You have successfully
	installed Gallery 2 Beta!
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="getting_started">Getting started with Gallery 2 Beta</a></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
	<b> Log in </b> - Once you&rsquo;ve successfully got Gallery 2 Beta installed, you should
	start by <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core.UserAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core.UserLogin&amp;g2_form[formName]=UserLogin&amp;g2_form[username]=admin" target="_guided">logging
	in</a> as the admin user that was created for you at install
	time.  The admin user has special privileges that you&rsquo;ll need
	in order to administer your new Gallery 2.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Activate Graphics Toolkits </b> - Click on the <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core.SiteAdmin" target="_guided">Site
	Admin</a> link then the <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core.SiteAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core.AdminModules"
	target="_guided">Modules</a> link to see the module list.
	Install, configure and activate one of the NetPBM,
	ImageMagick, or GD modules.  You can activate as many of them
	as you want (more is better, here).
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Add photos </b> - Browse back to <a
	href="main.php" target="_guided">the top of your new Gallery 2</a>
	and click on the <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core.ItemAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core.ItemAdd&amp;g2_itemId=6"
	target="_guided">Add Items</a> link.  This will bring up a
	page with a few different upload options (at least 3, more if
	you have other upload modules installed).  Select the one you
	want and try adding a new photo to your album.  If all goes
	well, you should see the new photos in your <a href="main.php"
	target="_guided">Gallery!</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Add an album </b> - You don't want to put all of your
	images into the top level of your Gallery 2, so you should try
	creating a new album.  Browse back to <a href="main.php"
	target="_guided">the top of your new Gallery 2</a> and click on the
	<a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core.ItemAdmin&amp;g2_subView=core.ItemAddAlbum&amp;g2_itemId=6"
	target="_guided">add sub-album</a> link from the left side of
	the page.  This will give you a form where you can enter
	information about the new album you want to create.  Fill it
	out and click the <b>Create</b> button.  Now try adding images
	to that album instead, or select the <b>Move Photo</b> link
	from under any of the images you added earlier and move them
	into this new album.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Import Gallery 1 albums </b> - you can easily import
	albums from Gallery 1.  It won&rsquo;t cause any harm
	to your Gallery 1.  Just go to the <a
	href="main.php?g2_view=core.SiteAdmin&amp;g2_subView=migrate.SelectGallery"
	target="_guided">Migration Page</a> and enter the path to your
	Gallery 1 albums directory and then follow the instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b> Plenty to do and see! </b> -

	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Activate the <b>Cart</b> and <b>Zip Download</b> modules, add

      target="_blank">file a bug</a> in our bug tracker on

      target="_blank">tracker guidelines</a> before filing a bug so
      that we can cut down on the number of spurious reports.  If
      you're unsure whether to file a bug you can always post in the
      forums first and we'll ask you to file a bug if needed.  If you
      want to talk about development issues, you can you can try to

      our primary means of communication, so if they ask you to post
      in the forums please respect their request.  If we spend all of
      our time doing tech support, we won't have time to write Gallery 2.

      Remember &ndash; reporting bugs is <b>good</b>.  Even if you think
      it&rsquo;s silly, go ahead and report it.  We can always close the bug
      or refile it (please don&rsquo;t be offended in this case) but it&rsquo;s
      harder to find bugs than it is to fix them so we&rsquo;re counting on
      you to help us with the finding part.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="known_issues">Known Issues / Bugs</a></h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
	<b>Login Problems</b> - There are known login problems where Gallery 2 seems to ignore
	a login request. In a first attempt to fix the problem most scenarios have been
	fixed, but we are still working on the complete solution. As a consequence of our
	changes you'll have to delete the GALLERYSID cookie(s) in your browser after an
	upgrade from version beta-2 (or prior) to beta-3 (or later).
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Layouts/Themes</b> - The current layout and theme
	architecture is going to change sometime during the beta
	cycle.  We are still considering several different approaches
	to make creating new themes, layouts and modules easier.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Performance</b> - This beta release is faster than the previous alphas/betas.
	There are still some tweaks that we have planned that will make it even faster.
	We&rsquo;ve still focused on features and reliability before performance, and
	will be continually optimizing during the beta cycle.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>URL Redirection</b> - Rewrite module and Gallery 1-&raquo;Gallery 2 URL redirection
	do not work together in the same .htaccess file (Gallery 2 is installed where
	Gallery 1 used to be). In future these will be compatible.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a name="multisite"></a>
	<b>Multisite config.php</b> - The multisite system has changed and old style
	multisite config.php files are no longer supported.  Follow these steps to move
	your sites to the new system:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Replace any symlinks created for multisite support with real directories
	    and/or remove any .htaccess files that were setup to redirect requests
	    from a multisite directory to the G2 codebase.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Examine your config.php file and learn the basics of its structure.  You
	    will find multiple complete single configurations that each start with
	    <tt>&lt;?php</tt> and end with <tt>?&gt;</tt>, with some additional content
	    above, below and between these sections.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Copy each configuration in the combined file into separate single files.
	    Each new file should have <tt>&lt;?php</tt> as the very first line and
	    <tt>?&gt;</tt> as the very last line with no extra spaces or blank lines
	    at the top or bottom, and there should be only one of each of these tags.
	    Place each new single config.php in the multisite directory for that site.
	    The <tt>case 'domain/path':</tt> line just above each configuration in the
	    combined file will help you determine which config.php goes in which
	    multisite directory.  Note that this "case" line does not go in the new
	    config.php file.  The last configuration in the combined file has
	    <tt>default:</tt> just above it instead of "case".  Rename the combined
	    file to something else and put this last configuration in place as the
	    config.php in this directory.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Now access the primary site and run through the upgrader.  Make sure
	    everything is working correctly with this site.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    For each additional site follow this process: browse to install/index.php
	    of the primary site.  In step 3 enter the path to the multisite directory
	    to update.  After this step you should see some new files in the multisite
	    directory, including <tt>upgrade/index.php</tt>.  At this point <i>stop</i>
	    using the installer and browse to <tt>upgrade/index.php</tt> for this site
	    (not the primary site).  Step through the upgrader to the upgrade core module
	    step.  After the core upgrade completes manually edit the config.php for this
	    site.  At the bottom you will find a <tt>galleryBaseUrl</tt> setting.
	    Enter the URL for the primary site here, ending with a /.  For example,
	    <tt>http://mydomain.com/gallery2/</tt> or <tt>http://photos.mydomain.com/</tt>.
	    Note this is the URL for the primary site, not the site you are currently
	    upgrading.  Save this change and finish the remaining steps of the upgrader.
	    Make sure this site now works correctly.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>View names</b> - In beta-4 the naming convention for views changed from using
	a colon separator to a period (core:ShowItem is now core.ShowItem).  All Gallery
	code has been updated but there are a few places you should check to make sure
	your site is up to date:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Local tpl files: make sure to update all view names in your customized
	    templates.  Compare to the current version of the default tpls if needed.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    External imageblock: update imageblock:External to imageblock.External in
	    any uses of this feature.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    PublishXP: Select 'add items' / Windows XP and follow the directions to
	    update your registry so it will reflect the new view name.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="updating">Updating your Gallery 2 Installation</a></h2>
    <p>
      Updating is quick and easy and should not lose any of your data.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	<a href="#get_latest_code">Get the latest code</a> and
	unpack it over your existing copy of Gallery 2. Keep your existing config.php in place, 
        and don't touch your (g2data) data folder or the database.
      </li>

      <li>
	If you use a PHP accelerator / cache (e.g. Turk mmCache,
	Ioncube PHPA, eaccelerator, Zend Studio, etc.), flush (clear)
	the cache of the accelerator.  Omitting this step can
	sometimes lead to errors during and after the upgrade process.
      </li>

      <li>
	Browse to <a href="upgrade/index.php">the upgrader</a> and follow the
	instructions there.  Make a backup of your data (g2data folder and the database) 
        when it tells you to!  Should you lose your data due to a bug in the
	upgrader, the first thing we're going to tell you to do is to
	restore from your backups!  (Then we'll probably ask you to
	help us reproduce the bug.)
      </li>

      <li>
	Enjoy your new version of Gallery 2.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="advanced_topics">Advanced Topics</a></h2>
    <p>
      <b> Unit Tests </b> - Gallery 2 was designed using <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.google.com/search?q=extreme+programming">Extreme
      Programming</a> methodologies.  This means that we have a ton of unit
      tests that help us make sure that the code is behaving as it should.  If
      you want to help us out, you can <a href="lib/tools/phpunit/index.php"
      target="_guided">try running the unit tests</a> and report back
      to us if any of them fail.  <i> Note </i> - these tests
      shouldn&rsquo;t change your Gallery 2 settings at all, but if they fail, they
      may leave things in a weird state.  Be warned that you might
      have to ditch your Gallery 2 data and start over if something
      catastrophic happens.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Test Harness </b> - We also have an <a
      href="lib/tools/test/index.php" target="_guided">older test harness</a> that
      we use to do some load testing type tasks that might be fun to
      experiment with.  Try creating 1000 users or a random tree of
      5,000 photos to see what it&rsquo;s like.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Localization </b> - If you&rsquo;re interested in localizing
      Gallery 2 into another language, you can <a
      href="lib/tools/reports/localization.php"
      target="_guided">review the current state of localization</a>
      and then <a href="docs/LOCALIZING" target="_guided">read the
      localization how-to</a> and get started.  <a
      href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=582564&amp;group_id=7130&amp;func=browse"
      target="_guided">Submit your localizations</a> early and often -
      no need to wait until you&rsquo;re entirely done.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> For Developers </b> - We've gotten started on some <a
      href="http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=phpWiki&amp;file=index&amp;pagename=Development%20Documents">developer documentation</a>
      that you should read if you want to start hacking on Gallery 2.  Some of the
      information is a little bit out of date or in early drafts, but it's a start.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Embedding </b> - See this <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=23957">forum topic</a>
      for the status of the integration modules to embed Gallery 2 in various applications.
      This <a href="docs/EMBEDDING">documentation</a> explains how to setup an integrated
