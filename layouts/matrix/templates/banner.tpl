 * If you want to customize this file, do not edit it directly.
 * Instead, copy it to banner.tpl.local and edit that version instead.
 * Gallery will look for that file first and use it if it exists
 * and when you upgrade, your changes will not get overwritten.
 * 
 * Add a sitewide banner to personalize your gallery.
