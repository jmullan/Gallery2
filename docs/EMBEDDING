___ Writing the integration code to embed G2 in another PHP application ___
   \___________________________________________________________________/

First install (separately) G2 and the app in which G2 will be embedded.
In this document "embedding application" is shortened to emApp.

Next you need an entry point in the emApp for all G2 requests, (similar to
main.php in G2 standalone).  This may be a module or plugin if the application
supports these, or a plain php file.  Determine the URI/path for your access
point and the G2 base directory, relative to your webserver document root.
Examples: __ access point __                   __ G2 base dir __
          appdir/gallery2.php                  appdir/gallery2
          appdir/plugins/gallery2.php          appdir/lib/gallery2
          appdir/index.php?module=gallery2     gallery2
Use these to determine the following values:
        embedURI = Filename (and possible query parameters) for access point
  relativeG2Path = Path from directory for access point to G2 base directory
For the above examples these settings are:
        __ embedURI __               __ relativeG2Path __
        gallery2.php                 gallery2
        gallery2.php                 lib/gallery2
        index.php?module=gallery2    ../gallery2
You'll also need a URI for a login page or main page of the app; G2 will
redirect here for access attempts without proper permissions.
Examples:  /  or  /appdir/login.php

The code in the access point to handle a G2 request looks something like this:

  require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . 'relative/path/to/gallery2/embed.php');
  $ret = GalleryEmbed::init(array(
           'embedUri' => {value}, 'relativeG2Path' => {value}, 'loginRedirect' => {value}));
  if ($ret->isError()) {
    // $ret->getAsHtml() has error details..
    exit;
  }

  list ($ret, $g2data) = GalleryEmbed::handleRequest();
  if ($ret->isError()) {
    // $ret->getAsHtml() has error details..
    exit;
  }

  if ($g2data['isDone']) {
    exit; // G2 has already sent output (redirect or binary data)
  }

  // Use $g2data['headHtml'] and $g2data['bodyHtml']
  // to display G2 content inside embedding application

Next decide if you want to support cookieless browsing.  Some extra steps are
required if G2 can't count on cookies to track its session id.  The emApp must
be able to provide a key=value string for its own session key and id, and have
an available API to store additional data in the session.
Here are the extra steps:
1) The input array for the GalleryEmbed::init() call must also contain:
        'embedSessionString' => {key=value}, 'gallerySessionId' => {value}
   (omit gallerySessionId when the value is not yet known)
2) After the init() call:
        $gallerySessionId = GallerEmbed::getSessionId();
        {store value in emApp's session}

Next decide between the following approaches for session synchronization:
A) Perform G2 login at same time as emApp login
B) On each G2 request make sure the active user in G2 matches emApp user
The main difference between these is with (A) a session in G2 is created for
the user at login time, even though the user may never visit a G2 page.  With
(B) the G2 session is created upon the first visit to G2.

To implement (A) you'll need hooks/callbacks/event-handlers for login/logout
operations in the emApp.  Code looks like this..
Login:
  require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . 'relative/path/to/gallery2/embed.php');
  $ret = GalleryEmbed::init();
  if ($ret->isSuccess()) {
    $ret = GalleryEmbed::login($emAppUserId);
    if ($ret->isSuccess()) {
      $ret = GalleryEmbed::done();
    }
  }
Logout:
  require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . 'relative/path/to/gallery2/embed.php');
  $ret = GalleryEmbed::logout();
For login, $emAppUserId is the id of the emApp user who has just logged in.

To implement (B) you need to find the active emApp user id in your G2
access point.  Pass this as a parameter to handleRequest:
  list ($ret, $g2data) = GalleryEmbed::handleRequest($emAppActiveUserId);
Pass in an empty string for anonymous/guest user (NOT the user id of the
emApp's anonymous user if it has an id).
With (B) you may also include the logout handler shown above.. it is not
required, but it resets the G2 session at logout so a session for a
logged-in user isn't left on the server.


more to come:
--- keep users in sync (event handlers for add/update/delete user)
--- decide whether to keep groups in sync (only skip this if emApp doesn't have groups)
--- keep groups in sync (event handlers for add/rename/delete group, add/remove member)
