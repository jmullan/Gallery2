1. OVERVIEW
-----------

Gallery is internationalized.  This means that instead of containing
language specific text messages, it tracks text in a special way such
that this text can be translated into other languages and a version of
the text can be displayed as appropriate for the viewer.

In order for the viewer to see Gallery's text in their own language,
somebody must first create a version of all the text messages that
Gallery is going to display in that specific language.  This process
is called "localization".

This document is a little sketchy at the moment, but I'll try to
outline in broad strokes how you can create and maintain localization
files for the content in G2.  It's not a particularly difficult thing
to do but it requires us to keep the various files up to date whenever
the underlying content changes.  Luckily we have tools that will aid
in this process.


2. REQUIREMENTS
---------------

In order to really do this effectively, you need to have a few tools
installed on your machine.  I've only tested this process on a FreeBSD
box, but my guess is that you won't have too much difficulty on Linux
or Solaris.  You may have difficulties following along on Windows, but
it should be possible.

  - gettext
    http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/

  - gmake
    http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html

I don't *think* that you need anything else.  But it's possible (let me
know).

3. CREATING A NEW LOCALIZATION
------------------------------

This is pretty straightforward.  Look around the Gallery distribution and
you'll find a bunch of directories called "po".  ("po" is a gettext term that
stands for "portable object").  Here's one way to find them:

	find . -type d -name po			<-- you type this

	./layouts/classic/po	          	<-- you see this
	./lib/tools/po
	./modules/core/po
	./modules/comment/po
	./modules/netpbm/po

** Ignore the "lib/tools/po" directory.

These directories contain translation source files.  You're going to
create a new file in this directory with an appropriate language code,
and then fill that file with translated text.  The first thing to do
is to identify the correct language code.  If the one that you want to
work on already exists, then skip to the next section ("Maintaining a
Localization").  Otherwise, you need to assemble a code from the
following two tables:

Language codes:
	http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt

Country codes:
	http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html

Your code should be of the format xx_XX (eg, "en_US" for English/United States,
or "el_GR" for Greek/Greece).  

Once you've chosen the code, you need to create a new .po file for
your code.  Let's assume that you chose "el_GR".  For each po directory,
you need to do this:

	gmake messages.po
	mv messages.po el_GR.po

Now edit el_GR.po.  It should have the Gallery license at the top of
the file, but you'll need to customize these values:

	"Project-Id-Version: xxx \n"
		-> Copy the project id from another .po file in the same directory
	
	"Last-Translator: \n"
		-> Put your name and email here in the format:
			"FirstName LastName <email@address>"

	"Language-Team: \n"
		-> Put in the language and the -devel mailing list, eg:
			"Greek <gallery-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>"

	"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1\n"
		-> Replace the charset with as appropriate 
		
	"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"
		-> Replace the encoding as appropriate

Next, you'll see a series of blocks like this:

	#, c-format		(this is optional)
	msgid "a message in english, with %d or %s tags in it"
	msgstr ""

You need to put the translation for the English message into the 
msgstr block, between the quotes, for example:

	#, c-format		(this is optional)
	msgid "a message in english, with %d or %s tags in it"
	msgstr "eine Anzeige auf englisch, mit %d oder %s etikettiert in ihr"

		(ok, that's German not Greek, but you get the idea)

Do that for every message.  When you're done, run:

	gmake install

And it will compile your .po file into a .mo file and install it in the 
appropriate place for the module.  Repeat this for every .po directory.
Finally, you need to edit modules/core/classes/GalleryTranslator.class
and in the constructor, add lines like this:

	$this->_supportedLanguages['el']['GR']['description'] = 'Greek';
	$this->_supportedLanguages['el']['GR']['charset'] = 'ISO-8859-1';

		(but put in the appropriate charset)

Now, log onto G2 and in the User preferences (you may need to edit the
user via the Site Administrator) you should see Greek appear in the
dropdown, and if you select it and log on as that user you'll see your
translated messages.

Check in your translation and you're done!  If you don't have permissions
to commit your change, email it to the mailing list (or to the appropriate
contact).

4. MAINTAINING A LOCALIZATION
-----------------------------

This is pretty straightforward.  We'll work out some kind of
notification system, but at any time you should be able to do this:

	cd po
	gmake el_GR.po  	(using Greek as an example)

This will extract all messages from the module that you're in, and update
the .po file.  Look through the .po file for any blocks that have an
empty msgstr, or are marked "fuzzy" and update them.

When you've got everything right, run:

	gmake install

Test your changes (see the "Creating a New Localization") section for 
testing info, and submit the new files to us.
