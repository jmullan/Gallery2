IMPLEMENTATION OF NOKIA IMAGE UPLOADER SERVER API V1.1

Author: Jerome Rannikko <jeromer@hotpop.com>

This module implements the Nokia Image Uploader Server API. 
The API specification can be found from the following address: 
http://forum.nokia.com/documents

Currently (module version 0.5) only the minimum functinality of 
the interface is implemented, namely sections 5.2, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 
5.5 and 5.6 of the specification.

The module doesn't need any configuration. All you need to do is to copy
the files in your Gallery's modules directory and activate the module
from the Site Admin view. In the future some configuration options might
be added.

When you install this module it will create an album on the top level of your Gallery. 
Also a new user group will be created called 'Mobile Users'. Only users of this group 
can add albums and other items to the mobile upload album. When user first logs in using
her Image Uploader enabled mobile phone (e.g. Nokia 3650 and 6600) she will be added to 
the Mobile users group. The login address is visible in the description of the album 
(make sure your layout/theme shows album descriptions).

If you don't have a mobile phone that supports the protocol you can still play with
the module. Set NOKIAUPLOAD_DEBUG to true in constants.inc. Then the module will read 
parameters from GET also. Normally only POST parameters are read as that is what the
specification requires. For example to login using the Image uploader module type
http://your.gallery/main.php?g2_controller=nokiaupload:Login&Username=<your username>
	&Password=<your password> 
in your browser's address field.

If you have trouble using the module you can enable logging to see what's going on. 
Set NOKIAUPLOAD_LOGGING to true in classes/LogFile.class. By default it's false. 
In the same file you can also set the log file location.
