IMPLEMENTATION OF NOKIA IMAGE UPLOADER SERVER API V1.1

Author: Jerome Rannikko <jeromer@hotpop.com>

This module implements the Nokia Image Uploader Server API. 
The API specification can be found from the following address: 
http://forum.nokia.com/documents

Currently only the minimum functinality of the interface is implemented,
namely sections 5.2, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6 of the specification.

When you install and configure this module it will create an album for uploads and a
new user group for 'Mobile Users'. Only users of this group can add albums and other
items to the mobile upload album. When user first logs in using her Image Uploader
enabled mobile phone (e.g. Nokia 3650 and 6600) she will be added to the mobile users
group. The login address is visible in the description of the album (make sure your
layout shows album descriptions).

If you don't have a mobile phone that supports the protocol you can still play with
the module. Set NOKIAUPLOAD_DEBUG to true in constants.inc. Then the module will read 
parameters from GET also. Normally only POST parameters are read as that is what the
specification requires. For example to login using the Image uploader module type
http://your.gallery/main.php?g2_controller=nokiaupload:Login&Username=<username>&Password=<password>
in your browser's address field.

If you have trouble using the module you can enable logging to see what's going on. 
Set NOKIAUPLOAD_LOGGING to true in classes/LogFile.class. By default it's false. 
In the same file you can also set the log file location.
