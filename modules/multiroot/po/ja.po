"This option defines a default album for this view and adjusts navigation links so that no "
"parent albums above the default are shown.  Both guests and logged in users accessing the "
"alternate URL will see this effect.  However, Gallery permissions are unchanged so modules "
"like imageblock and search, or manually entered URLs, can lead visitors to items outside the "

"The original/real guest user must have view permission for all items accessible by any "

"already public and can remain that way, no more setup is required.  Setup for mutually "
"exclusive views is more complicated: the original guest user must have access to items in "
"all views, so first setup those permissions.  Then use the tools here to create each "
"alternate view.  Just use the set of alternate URLs.  Keep the original Gallery URL "
