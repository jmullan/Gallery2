 * As a security precaution, we limit access to Gallery's install and setup
 * functionality to thosse people who know the password, below.  The first time
 * around, you must pick a password and enter it here in clear text.  Example:
 *
 *  $gallery->setConfig('setup.password', 'A PASSWORD');
 *
 * Choose something random and enter it in plain text.  You don't have to
 * remember it because you can always refer to this file.  You'll only be asked
 * for this password when you run Gallery's setup code.  We don't provide a
 * default password because we want you to choose one of your own (which
 * lessens the chance that you'll get hacked).

/*
 * In order for Gallery to manage your data, you must provide it with
 * a directory that it can write to.  Gallery is a webserver application,
 * so the directory that you create must be writeable by the
 * webserver, not just by you.  
 *
 * This directory can be anywhere on your filesystem.  For security purposes,
 * it's better if the directory is not accessible via your webserver (ie, it
 * should not be in your DocumentRoot).
 *
 * You have to create this directory

 * Gallery can store its data in multiple different back ends.  Currently we
 * support only MySQL.  Enter the hostname where your database lives, and the
 * username and password you use to connect to it.
 *
 * You must specify a database name, but you do not need to create the database
 * yourself.  Gallery will do it for you.  However, Gallery requires that the
 * user account you provide has the following permissions on the database you
 * specified:
 *
 *    CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER
 *
 * If you want Gallery to coexist in a database with tables from other
 * applications, you can specify a prefix to prepend to all table and column
 * names.  By default these prefixes are as shown below.  If you modify these
 * after Gallery has created its various tables, it will stop working.

 * Put Gallery into debug mode.  Useful for tracking down problems with the
 * application.  Not a good idea to leave it this way, though.  Possible debug
 * choices are: 'buffered', 'logged', 'immediate' or false.
 *
 * If you choose 'immediate', you'll see debugging information as soon as
 * Gallery generates it.  This can be useful at times, but it'll screw up some
 * parts of the application flow.
 *
 * If you choose 'buffered', Gallery will display debug information in a table
 * as part of the application.  You won't necessarily get *all* the debug
 * information but the application should work normally.
 *
 * If you choose 'logged', you must also specify:
 *    $gallery->setDebugLogFile('/path/to/writeable/file');
 * and all debug output will get printed into that file.  You'll get all the
 * debug output and the application will work normally.
