    Gallery needs to create the directory, below, but it can&rsquo;t.
    This may be because the permissions of the parent directory
    are too restrictive.

    <?php include(dirname(__FILE__) . '/directoryDetailsFragment.inc'); ?>
    <?php include(dirname(__FILE__) . '/openBasedirFragment.inc'); ?>
