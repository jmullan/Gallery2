Welcome to Gallery 2.0.  Currently this is in a *very* pre-alpha
state.  I'm still working on the overall framework, and I'm taking the
time to really do it right.  Once I'm satisfied that it's good and
solid, I'll start to add all the various application features.

You should be able to install and play with a new G2 by following
these instructions:

1. Get the latest G2 code

2. Wipe out your existing data tree.  This is not absolutely 
necessary, but it's helpful in terms of providing feedback
on the install process.  You should probably wipe your old G2
database, if you have one, as the data model may change without
notice.  If you've got G2 installed, a fast way to do this is to
go to the test harness:

	setup/test/index.php

and run the "EmptyGallery" and then "RemoveStore" tests.  Note that if
you're running a version of G2 from before, say, 10/21/2002 then this
may not work for you 'cause I fixed some bugs in it.  So in that case,
you should blow away your gallery data directory and drop your database
by hand.

3. Copy setup/config.php-dist to gallery/config.php and edit it.
There are instructions in the file.  It should be pretty self
explanatory.  I recommend setting your debug mode to 'buffered'
so that you can see what's happening.

4. Browse to gallery/setup/setup.php and follow its instructions.
They are pretty sparse at the moment, but it *should* walk you
through the process of creating a new data directory and a new
database.  If it fails, you might want to look through the code.
It's entirely in setup/setup.php

5. Browse to the top level:

	http://your.server/gallery/main.php

   Click the [login] link and enter "admin" as the username and
   your setup password (the one you entered in config.php) as the
   password.  This should log you in.

6. You'll get a [site admin] link at the top.  Click that to go to
   the Gallery Site Administrator.  You can go to it by hand at:

	main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin

   6a.  Go to the 'modules' tab.  Click the 'install' link next
        to NetPBM.  Then click the 'configure' link.  Enter the path
        to your NetPBM binaries and save it.  Repeat until all test
        results are positive.

   6b.  Go to the 'modules' tab.  Click the 'activate' link next to
	NetPBM.

   6c.  Go to the 'modules' tab.  Click the 'install' and then
	'activate' links next to 'comment'.

7. We don't yet have an interface to add images.  But we can do it
   via the test harness.  Browse to the test harness:

	setup/test/index.php

   7a.  Click the 50, 500, 1K or 10K link next to 'CreateRandomTree'.
	This will create a relatively boring tree of albums and 
	photos for you.

   7b.  Click the 50, 500, 1K or 10K link next to 'CreateRandomUser'.
	This will create a relatively boring user base for you.

8. Go to the main interface:

	main.php

   and browse around.

9. Try adding a comment on an album or item.  

10. Browse back to gallery/main.php and you should be able to 
see your tree and wander around it.

11. Browse to gallery/main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin and you'll
see the Site Admin framework.  User and group management are
functionally complete now.  Try creating and editting users and
groups, and try adding and removing users from groups.

I'm still working on getting the framework just right before I go too far
into any one module.  Clearly there's still a lot of stuff missing.  Some
of it is cosmetic, some of it structural.

* We're not generating thumbnails for albums, so the albums just show
  up as their id value.

* The classic layout is pretty boring.

* Navigation between Site Admin and regular mode needs work

* The item administration code is not yet in

* Haven't yet implemented these features:
	- rating
	- printing
	- slideshow
	- workflow (notifications, moderation, etc)
  These will all be modules and won't require changing the core code.
