Welcome to Gallery 2.0.  Currently this is in a pre-alpha state.  I'm
still working on the overall framework, and I'm taking the time to
really do it right.  Once I'm satisfied that it's good and solid, I'll
start to add all the various application features.

You should be able to install and play with a new G2 by following
these instructions:

1. Get the latest G2 code

2. Create a directory for gallery to store album and other data.  This
   must be writeable by the web server, but doesn't need to be in the web
   root.  It would be advisable to NOT put this directory in the web root.

3. Create a database.  Right now we support PostgreSQL and MySQL.  
   Older versions of G2 would create your database for you, but that 
   turned out not to be portable to Postgres so we now require that
   you create the database yourself. You must also give gallery full
   access to this database.  Choose your own username and password.

   MySQL:
   mysqladmin -uroot create gallery2
   mysql gallery2 -uroot -e"GRANT ALL ON gallery2.* TO \
        username@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password'"

   (Note:  if mysql denies you access, try adding "-p"
        right before the "-e ")

   Postgres:
   createdb gallery2
   (see the postgres documentation to set permssions or use a tool
        such as webmin or phpPgAdmin to set them)

4. Copy gallery2/setup/config.php-dist to gallery2/config.php and edit it.
   There are instructions in the file.  It should be pretty self
   explanatory.  I recommend setting your debug mode to 'buffered' so
   that you can see what's happening.

5. Browse to http://your.server/gallery2/setup/setup.php and follow
   its instructions.

   *************************************************************
   * NOTE!  DO NOT BROWSE TO THE MAIN GALLERY PAGE BEFORE YOU  *
   * RUN THE SETUP.PHP SCRIPT OR THE INSTALLER WILL FAIL!      *
   *                                                           *
   * YOU MUST GO *DIRECTLY* TO SETUP.PHP                       *
   * (yes we will fix this problem someday soon!)              *
   *                                                           *
   *************************************************************

   They are pretty sparse at the moment, but it *should* walk you
   through the process of creating a new data directory and a new
   database.  If it fails, you might want to look through the code.
   It's entirely in setup/setup.php

6. Browse to the top level:

   http://your.server/gallery/main.php

   Click the [login] link and enter "admin" as the username and
   your setup password (the one you entered in config.php) as the
   password.  This should log you in.

7. You'll get a [site admin] link at the top.  Click that to go to
   the Gallery Site Administrator.  You can go to it by hand at:

   http://your.server/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin

   In order for Gallery to really work properly, you need to 
   make sure that you have configured support for all the various
   modules that come with G2.  We try to automatically configure
   most of the modules, so you should check for ones that are not
   marked "active".  If they're already active, you don't need to
   do anything.  
   
   7a.  Go to the 'modules' tab.  Click the 'install' link next
        to NetPBM (or ImageMagick).  Then click the 'configure' link.
        Enter the path to your NetPBM (or ImageMagick) binaries and
        save it.  Repeat until all test results are positive.

   7b.  Go to the 'modules' tab.  Click the 'activate' link next to
        NetPBM (or ImageMagick).

   7c.  Go to the 'modules' tab.  Click the 'install' and then
        'activate' links next to 'comment'.

8. Go back to the top level of the Gallery.  There's no link back
   right now so you have to enter:

   http://your.server/gallery/main.php

   by hand.  Click [edit item] and edit the properties of the top
   level album.  When you're done adding photos, click on the icon
   in the top left (or "no thumbnail" if you're at the top level)
   to go back to the main album view.

9. Use the test harness to create a whole bunch of albums and photos
   (this is a nice way to see what a fully populated gallery is going to 
   look like).  Browse to the test harness:

   http://your.server/gallery/setup/test/index.php

   9a.  Click the 50, 500, 1K or 10K link next to 'CreateRandomTree'.
        This will create a relatively boring tree of albums and 
        photos for you.

   9b.  Click the 50, 500, 1K or 10K link next to 'CreateRandomUser'.
        This will create a relatively boring user base for you.

10. Go to the main interface:

	http://your.server/gallery/main.php

    and browse around.

11. Try adding a comment on an album or item.

12. Browse back to

    http://your.server/gallery/main.php

    and you should be able to see your tree and wander around it.

13. Browse to

    http://your.server/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin

    and you'll see the Site Admin framework.  User and group
    management are functionally complete now.  Try creating and
    editing users and groups, and try adding and removing users
    from groups.

14. Browse to

    http://your.server/gallery/setup/phpunit

    and you'll see the unit test framework run through all of its
    tests.  They should all succeed. Note that some of them don't
    clean up after themselves fully!

UPDATING YOUR GALLERY INSTALLATION

   There is more than one way to update your gallery2 installation.
   Most of the time you should reinstall the hard way (by hand).

The easy way:

1. Get the latest G2 code.
   cvs update -d

2. A fast way to do this is to go to the test harness:

   http://your.server/gallery/setup/test/index.php

   and run the "ReInitializeGallery" test case which does a whole
   lot of stuff and should clean and reset your Gallery, however be
   warned: that test case was written to help me do development and
   it has hardcoded configuration settings (like the locations of
   the ImageMagick binaries, etc).

Doing it by hand:

1. Get the latest G2 code.
   cvs update -d

2. Wipe out your existing data tree and database. You may not have to
   do this after every single update, but I'm busy making structural
   changes all the time so DON'T expect things to continue working.  I
   reserve the right to change the data structures whenever I want.

   rm -r /path/to/gallerydata/*

3. Drop and recreate the gallery2 database.

   MySQL:
       mysqladmin -uroot drop gallery2
       mysqladmin -uroot create gallery2
 
   Postgres:
       dropdb gallery2
       createdb gallery2

4. It may be necessary to redo your config.php.  Copy
   gallery/setup/config.php-dist to gallery/config.php and edit it
   again.

5. Browse to gallery/setup/setup.php and follow its instructions.

6. Browse to the top level and log in as "admin" again.
   http://your.server/gallery/main.php

7. Install and activate your modules again.

8. Browse to gallery/setup/phpunit and you'll see the unit test 
   framework run through all of its tests.  They should all succeed.
   Note that some of them don't clean up after themselves fully!
