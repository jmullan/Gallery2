Welcome to Gallery 2.0.  Currently this is in a *very* pre-alpha state. 
I'm still working on the overall framework, and I'm taking the time to
really do it right.  Once I'm satisfied that it's good and solid, I'll
start to add all the various application features.

You should be able to install and play with a new G2 by following
these instructions:

1. Get the latest G2 code

2. Wipe out your existing data tree.  This is not absolutely 
necessary, but it's helpful in terms of providing feedback
on the install process.  You should probably wipe your old G2
database, if you have one, as the data model may change without
notice.

3. Copy setup/config.php-dist to gallery/config.php and edit it.
There are instructions in the file.  It should be pretty self
explanatory.  I recommend setting your debug mode to 'buffered'
so that you can see what's happening.

4. Browse to gallery/setup/setup.php and follow its instructions.
They are pretty sparse at the moment, but it *should* walk you
through the process of creating a new data directory and a new
database.  If it fails, you might want to look through the code.
It's entirely in setup/setup.php

5. Browse to the Gallery Site Administrator:

	main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin

   5a.  Go to the 'modules' tab.  Click the 'configure' link next
        to NetPBM.  Enter the path to your NetPBM binaries and save
	it.  Repeat until all test results are positive.

   5b.  Go to the 'modules' tab.  Click the 'activate' link next to
	NetPBM.

   5c.  Go to the 'modules' tab.  Click the 'configure' link next
	to 'comment'.  Click the 'configure' button.

   5d.  Go to the 'modules' tab.  Click the 'activate' link next to
	'comment'.

6. We don't yet have an interface to add images.  But we can do it
   via the test harness.  Browse to the test harness:

	setup/test/index.php

   6a.  Click the 50, 500, 1K or 10K link next to 'CreateRandomTree'.
	This will create a relatively boring tree of albums and 
	photos for you.

7. Go to the main interface:

	main.php

   and browse around.

8. Try adding a comment on an album or item.  

By this point, you should be able to go to your main Gallery
page which will be unimpressive.  It'll have no data in it
so you'll just see a pretty empty table at the top of the page
and a whole lot of debug stuff below.


6. Configure NetPBM and activate it.  Vallimar, I have changed
so much stuff around here that I haven't had a chance to get your
ImageMagick code in yet :-/.  Immediately after activating NetPBM
the UI may still report it as inactive.  Click the "test harness"
link at the top of the page (that triggers a clean refresh) and
it should say "active"

7. Run 500 iterations of CreateRandomTree.  This will simulate
creating a (pretty boring) tree of photos and albums for you.

8. Browse back to gallery/main.php and you should be able to 
see your tree and wander around it.

9. Browse to gallery/main.php?g2_view=core:SiteAdmin and you'll
see the Site Admin framework.  It is /very/ weak right now; I've
really just been working on the framework.  But it'll give you
an idea of how things should work.
