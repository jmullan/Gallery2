 * If you want to customize this file, do not edit it directly.
 * Instead, copy it to standalone.tpl.local and edit that version instead.
 * Gallery will look for that file first and use it if it exists
 * and when you upgrade, your changes will not get overwritten.

 * This file is for views that wish to present the entire <html> block
 * instead of just providing <head> and <body> data.  Anything that is
 * displayed using this template will take over the entire page,
 * instead of showing up inside the themed block, so it won't have the
 * standard header and footer.  It should only be used sparingly for
 * modal dialogs, etc.
