 * If you want to customize this file, do not edit it directly.
 * Instead, copy it to redirect.tpl.local and edit that version instead.
 * Gallery will look for that file first and use it if it exists
 * and when you upgrade, your changes will not get overwritten.
 *
 * This template is only used for debugging purposes.  When G2 redirects
 * you to a new page, sometimes the developers want to see the debug output 
 * from the code that generated the redirect, so we have this intermediate
 * page that shows the debug output and a link you can click to complete
 * the redirect.  
 *
 * You shouldn't have to modify this page unless you're a G2 developer.
